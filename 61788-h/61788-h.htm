<h2>Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>The period of the &ldquo;Swiss Heroes&rdquo; romance
is in the days of Charles the Bold,
Duke of Burgundy; and the sentiment
of its title is to be found in the careers
of the three heroes, Hans V&ouml;geli, his brother Heinrich
V&ouml;geli, who gave his life to establish his Swiss
citizenship, and Walter Irmy. A short sketch of
the relations of Charles the Bold to the Swiss is all
that is needful as a preface to the stirring story
which the German author has told so well and so
accurately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>Charles the Bold, son of Philip the Good, of
Burgundy, and Isabella of Portugal, one of the
most conspicuous figures at the close of the Middle
Ages, was born in 1433. He became Duke of
Burgundy in 1467 and shortly afterwards took as
his second wife Margaret, the sister of Edward IV
of England. After years of war with Louis of
France, which eventually ended in his success, and
urged on by his inordinate ambition, he determined
to erect an independent kingdom under his own
sovereignty. With this end in view he entered into
negotiations with Emperor Frederick, offering to
marry his daughter to the Emperor&rsquo;s son, in case
he himself were elected king of the Romans. The
Emperor proposed, however, to make him king of
Burgundy at Treves, but the scheme was thwarted
by the Electors, who persuaded the former to leave
the city secretly. Four years previously (1469),
Sigismund, Duke of Austria, had sold Alsace to
Charles, and the latter appointed Peter von Hagenbach
its governor. His career of cruel oppression
and the vengeance which the people wreaked upon
him are vividly described in this little romance.
Charles was so enraged that he gave up the country
to waste and slaughter. But meanwhile powerful
allies were united against him. Louis of France
had secured the alliance of the Swiss; and Sigismund,
who was anxious to get Alsace back, joined
the French. The English deserted him and signed
a treaty of peace with Louis. Battle after battle
was fought, in which the Swiss were victorious;
and at last the troops of Ren&eacute;, the dispossessed
duke of Lorraine, aided by the Swiss troops, won
a great victory under the walls of Nancy, January
5, 1477. The Burgundians were routed and Charles
was killed. The heroism of the Swiss stands out
conspicuously in this romance; but among all the
characters in the stirring drama none is more alluring,
more pathetic, more glorious, than Heinrich
V&ouml;geli, who won his restoration to citizenship by
his heroic death.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Saint Jacob&rsquo;s Day</span></h2>
<p>On the twenty-sixth of August, in the year
1473, a lively party passed out through
the gate of the old city of Basle<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> and
briskly took their way along the road to
Saint Jacob, following the course of the river Birs.
First came two sturdy burghers, Councillor Hans
Irmy, a merchant of some consequence, and the
head of a large and wealthy house, the revenues of
which were constantly being increased by agents
in Venice, Genoa, Augsburg, and Nuremberg; and
Ulrich Iseli, landlord of The Bears of Basle, the
largest tavern in the city. Iseli was a good customer
of Irmy&rsquo;s in foreign wines and provisions.
Following them was a band of youths, led by a
young apprentice of the house of Irmy, Heini
S&uuml;ssbacher of Aarau.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> Walter, the Councillor&rsquo;s only
son, was the central figure of this group, the others
crowding closely about him. He was a lad of some
sixteen years, with a frank, good-natured countenance,
and of a size and strength beyond his years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Up hill and down dale they went, till perspiration
streamed from the brow of the corpulent Councillor
and he could scarcely keep pace with his more
youthful companion Iseli, who, unlike the most of
his calling, was tall and spare and had preserved
much of the elasticity of youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gently! gently! my friend,&rdquo; said Irmy at length.
&ldquo;Make haste slowly. We shall still reach our
journey&rsquo;s end before night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;but I would
fain be home again in good season. The dignitaries
of the town will mark my absence from the guests&rsquo;
room and, doubtless, distinguished persons will have
arrived by the time we return. Methinks you are
wont to be quick enough in other respects.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;That indeed,&rdquo; returned Irmy, &ldquo;and well has
my quickness served me in life; wherefore it
troubles me the less that I can no longer follow
you either with my legs or with my hopes and
thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, let us not return to the French,&rdquo; said the
innkeeper, &ldquo;for on that point we shall never agree.
I maintain that Switzerland cannot do better than to
place herself under the protection of the French
crown. Never has the house of Austria dealt fairly
by us, nor should we forget what Tell and his companions
did for their country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied the magistrate; &ldquo;but I greatly
doubt if we should meet with any better treatment
from France than we did from Gessler and his accomplices
in those days. Moreover, you must remember
&rsquo;tis but thirty years since Austria and France formed
an alliance against us that might have proved our
destruction. You should be ashamed to speak the
word &lsquo;France&rsquo; on this day, the anniversary of the
battle of Saint Jacob. Those who sleep here would
turn in their graves, could they hear you talk so.
Think you I bear these scars in vain? Never can I
forget the wrongs France has inflicted upon our Confederation,
and if need be I will prove to her that
my arm is still of use, not only to keep account
books and handle pepper sacks, but also to smite
French helms till the sparks fly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks that will scarcely be needful,&rdquo; answered
his companion; &ldquo;your Walter here is already
quite capable of taking your place should occasion
demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be glad to have him at my side,&rdquo; said
Irmy; &ldquo;he is a good lad, and it pleases me not a
little that he seems to take as kindly to the use of
arms as I did in my younger days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youths by this time had overtaken them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; called Walter, &ldquo;are those vineyards we
see over yonder on the hill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, my son; and they yield a wine more
precious to us Swiss than any in all the world, for
upon that hill some of the noblest sons of Switzerland
lie buried. From the vines that grow above
them is made a wine we call &lsquo;Switzer&rsquo;s blood&rsquo; and
drink in remembrance of the battle of Saint Jacob,
to honor the fallen and as an inspiration to the
present generation to emulate their fathers in courage
and devotion to the Fatherland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have often promised to tell us,&rdquo; said
Walter, &ldquo;what happened thirty years ago, when you
were so sorely wounded by the French.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come then; let us go up the hill and seat ourselves;
from there we shall have a better view of
the battle-field,&rdquo; replied the Councillor. When this
had been done he began as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty years ago matters stood with us much
as they now do. The Confederates were never in
harmony: cities and cantons conspired against one
another, and the nobles were the enemy of both.
Schwyz was at strife with Zurich over some hereditary
question; and Zurich, being powerless to cope
single-handed against the older cantons, did not
scruple to ally herself with Austria, the hereditary
foe of the Confederation. Civil strife, the worst of
all wars, broke out; many towns and castles were
destroyed. One of our most formidable enemies was
Thomas von Falkenstein, who from his stronghold
at Farnsburg committed constant depredations upon
us Confederates, and at last seized upon one of my
father&rsquo;s pack-trains going from Genoa to Basle, laden
with Indian spices. This roused the people to fury,
and together with a force from other cantons we
young men of Basle camped before Farnsburg, toward
which we sent salute after salute with our carbines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then a report reached us that the Dauphin of
France was approaching with a vast army, some said
of a hundred thousand, others a hundred and fifty
thousand, and still others two hundred thousand men,
fierce marauders who had grown wild and lawless
during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War between France and
England. &lsquo;Arme Gecken,&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> or miserable beggars,
the people called them, because though they subsisted
on pillage and plunder they still looked ragged and
half starved. Wild confusion arose in camp at this
news, and all were eager to rush at once against the
foe. There were six thousand of us stout Switzers;
why should we fear one hundred thousand Frenchmen?
The leaders had hard work to make us listen
to reason and consent that the main part of our force
should remain before the beleaguered castle, while
twelve hundred of us went down into the valley
of the Birs to learn the truth of the report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hemmann Seevogel was placed in command,
and we rode briskly off down the hill. When we
reached the Birsthal we were warned that the enemy
was much too strong for us, but we laughed to scorn
all caution, and the mighty herdsmen of Schwyz and
Uri smote the trees as they passed with their iron-spiked
clubs till great pieces flew from them, to show
how much stronger they were than any foe could
possibly be. A few of the leaders would have
turned back, but the scoffs and jeers of their comrades
forced them to keep on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;At Pratteln we found the vanguard of the
enemy posted, eight thousand strong, under Count
von Dammartin, but it was not long before they abandoned
the position and took to their heels, leaving
a thousand dead and wounded on the field. They
fled to Muttenz, where ten thousand Armagnacs
were waiting to receive the fugitives. But we were
close behind, and our gigantic herdsmen laid about
them with their heavy weapons so lustily that the
hearts of the Frenchmen sank into their tattered
hose. Out of Muttenz we twelve hundred drove
these eighteen thousand so easily there was little
pleasure in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our leaders now were for making a halt, declaring
we had won enough and should only lose
by a further advance, for the Dauphin with the
main army was stationed beyond the Birs at Saint
Jacob; and as the bridge over the river had been
destroyed, it would be foolhardy to attempt to cross.
But intoxicated with our previous successes, we were
determined to push on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We will sup in Basle to-night, cost what it may!&rsquo;
we shouted. &lsquo;The Evil One with all his legions
shall not keep us from the town. He who hangs
back is a traitor! No commands shall turn us from
our duty to the Fatherland!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Armagnacs had long since disappeared from
view. We reached the Birs unmolested, waded
through the stream, and gained the further bank.
There, however, we were met by such a hail of iron
from the French guns that it was impossible to keep
our ranks, while all attempts to rally the scattered
forces were quickly defeated by the enemy&rsquo;s heavy
horsemen. Many now repented their rash determination,
but there was no help for it&mdash;retreat was
no longer possible with honor. Forward we must
go to meet the forty thousand men opposed to us.
They offered a stout resistance. German knights
fought in their front ranks, and there were traitorous
noblemen of our country among the enemy; but
they did us no harm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred of our number retreated to a
meadow which was protected by the river from
attack by horsemen, but they were shot down one
by one. Another five hundred took refuge in the
leper hospital of Saint Jacob, which was over yonder
where the little chapel now stands. About the
building lay a large orchard surrounded by a wall,
which would check for a time the enemy&rsquo;s assault.
I was with this party, and glad enough to find myself
safe, as I thought, behind this barrier. Soon,
however, the muzzles of their guns were pointed
toward us; the garden wall and building were
quickly demolished, and when the firing had ceased
we were attacked by the German knights, who had
sworn to slay us all, burgher and peasant. Thrice
indeed we repulsed them, and many a high-born lord
lay weltering in his blood; but our number was
fast diminishing, and as I received the blow on the
head to which this scar still bears witness, the enemy
burst into the burning hospital over the bodies of
the five hundred Switzers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;When I came to my senses again it was dark;
above me shone the stars, and all was silent save for
an occasional groan from one of the wounded, or
the crackling of flames, which still fed upon the
heavy timbers of the building. The night was cold,
but by good fortune I lay in such a position among
the ruins of the garden wall that I was somewhat
sheltered from the wind and almost hidden from
sight. Gradually the events of the past day came
back to me, and my bosom swelled with pride.
We had shown how men should fight who are
guardians of their fatherland, their homes, and their
families. Not a man lay there that was not covered
with wounds: each had fought as long as strength
remained in him to smite the foe. Had I not been
so weak and faint I could have shouted aloud because
of the victory won by the Swiss burgher-folk
over the political craft and power of princes. The
overwhelming odds had been too much for us, but
even in death and defeat we had shown that something
higher than the Armagnacs&rsquo; lust for spoil, or
the pride and ambition of the knights, had urged
us to battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had plenty of time to indulge these thoughts,
for I was not disturbed for many long hours. At
last, toward morning, it seemed to me I heard
stealthy footsteps among the debris. Nearer and
nearer they came, till in the dim light I saw quite
near to me the figure of a man stooping down to
give water to one of my wounded comrades. Parched
with fever from my wound, I also feebly besought
him for a drink. He took a few steps to the angle
of the wall where I lay, and stopped short, unable
to suppress a low cry of astonishment. &lsquo;You here,
young sir,&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;and in such a plight?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Quick! give me some water,&rsquo; I begged; &lsquo;my
father will reward you for it. Greet him for me
and tell him I died as all true citizens of a free State
should die&mdash;on the tottering bulwark of freedom
and justice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, you are a long way yet from death,&rsquo;
replied the man; &lsquo;with good fortune I shall fetch
you safely back to Basle this very night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who may you be,&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;that talk of such
impossibilities?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He laughed. &lsquo;That, methought, you would
have known long since, for we have met many times
in your father&rsquo;s house. I am Gerard, the smuggler
of Neuch&acirc;tel, and have carried many bales of merchandise
to him. Indeed I have a pack with me
now, which I have just brought through the French
camp; but perchance he will not take it amiss if I
leave that here and carry you to Basle in its place.
Once under your mother&rsquo;s wing you will soon
forget these thoughts of death.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;By this time I had satisfied my thirst, and
Gerard stole softly away to reconnoitre, as he said.
It was now light, and from my corner I could look
over all the surrounding country. The battle-field
was deserted save for a few scattered bands of
horsemen moving hither and thither. Three of
them at length drew near my hiding-place, whom I
quickly recognized as Swiss nobles, traitors to their
country, and rejoicing in the sufferings of their fellow-countrymen.
One, named Werner von Staufen,
laughed scornfully as he surveyed the ruins piled
with corpses, when suddenly one of my mortally
wounded comrades started up, seized a stone from
the shattered wall, and with a last effort flung it full
at the knight, hurling him to the ground, where he
expired together with his assailant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others now began to pry about among the
debris to see if there might be other Switzers still
alive. Burghard M&ouml;nch, of Landskr&ouml;n, stepped
forward and, pointing to the crimson blood-stains,
cried to his companion, &lsquo;Look at the roses that
have blossomed in the night!&rsquo; At this, Captain
Arnold Schick of Uri lifted himself painfully, a
heavy stone in his right hand. &lsquo;Here&mdash;take this
rose!&rsquo; he cried, and dashed it at the head of the
knight, who fell headlong, his armor clanging
sharply against the stones. The third quickly
abandoned the pleasures of a search for still breathing
foes, and, mounting his horse, galloped away so
swiftly that the sparks flew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Scarcely had he disappeared when Gerard returned.
&lsquo;We must be quick, young sir,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;for in another half-hour the whole army will be
back again to avenge the death of yonder knights.
I have hidden my pack and will come for it again
in a few days. Quickly, now, and hold tight to my
neck, for I must needs run if we are to reach the
Birs in safety.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;So saying, he lifted me carefully upon his back
and started off, picking his way cautiously over the
stones. He must have been about thirty years old
at that time, and was as strong as a giant; yet I
doubted much if we should escape, for a couple of
horsemen not more than a thousand paces away
caught sight of us and gave chase. Luckily the
Birs was not far, and Gerard well-nigh flew over
the ground with me. Almost swooning, I still heard
clearly the thundering hoof-beats behind us, as even
now after all these years I often hear them in my
dreams. Suddenly Gerard stumbled, and I fell heavily
to the ground and rolled down a short declivity
into the river. I thought all was over, but the cold
water instantly restored me to consciousness. I was
dipping it up with both hands and pouring it over
my fevered brow and wounds, when my pursuer
appeared above me on the bank. Finding his horse
unable to clamber down the steep incline he dismounted.
Again I took to flight and struggled
on till the water rose to my breast; but by that
time Gerard was once more at my side. Gaining
the farther shore we looked back and found that
our pursuer had not ventured into the water at all,
but had already remounted and was making his way
back to the camp. But my last remnant of strength
was exhausted. My senses left me; and when I
awoke to consciousness some days later under my
father&rsquo;s roof, my mother told me how Gerard had
borne me along the river bank to a thicket, where
he had waited till darkness fell; then, crossing the
stream once more, he had brought me safely to the
gates of the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The French had experienced quite enough of
Swiss valor, and the Dauphin ordered a retreat,
having no wish to sacrifice his people in a war
which brought them small thanks from Austria, in
whose behalf it was undertaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; asked Walter thoughtfully, &ldquo;why did
not the people of Basle come to your aid? Surely
there were enough men there to help you, and
together you could have defeated the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;At first,&rdquo; replied the Councillor, &ldquo;they did not
know of our approach, and when the news reached
them the Burgomaster and Council hastily met to
decide what should be done. But some of the
Councillors at that time were not of the bravest, and
their first thought was for the safety of their own
town. The report of our victories at Pratteln and
Muttenz was said to have been spread by the enemy
to draw away from Basle all who were capable of
defending it. The burghers sat too long in debate,
however. A workman in the public square snatched
the banner of the town from the banneret&rsquo;s hand in
the corn market, shouting to the assembled throng,
&lsquo;Follow me, all who are true citizens of Basle!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;More than three thousand burghers hastened to
join him, and the rest soon followed. Hans Roth, the
Burgomaster, placed himself at the head of this valorous
band, each of whom had stuck a wisp of straw
in his belt as a badge, and away they marched through
the Saint Alban&rsquo;s Gate to attack the foe. Anxiously
the magistrates and remaining citizens watched their
departure, for none were left within the walls that
could wield a weapon or had courage enough to
look the enemy in the face. Who was there to protect
the town in case of sudden attack? Scarcely
a quarter of an hour had passed, when one of the
Councillors galloped madly after the champions, with
word that an assault had been made on the city and an
ambuscade laid for them by the enemy. Thereupon
they turned back, only to learn, when too late, that
the faint-hearted Council had deceived them. Truly
it was no great honor in those days to be a Councillor
in the good city of Basle, and it is only
within a few years that they have earned the right
to be held in respect once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame on them!&rdquo; exclaimed Walter. &ldquo;Father,
if the French should come now, I do not believe <i>you</i>
would hold the burghers back. You would let me
go with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, and go myself withal,&rdquo; said Hans Irmy.
&ldquo;We have that within us which time cannot destroy
or change. They thought to tear away a portion
of our Confederation, and not the worst part either;
but we kept faith with the German Empire and held
fast to the soil from which we sprung. No Frenchman
shall take that from us, not even our language,
which like ourselves has been German from the
beginning.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be too hard upon the French,&rdquo; interposed
Iseli; &ldquo;the French language is by no means
to be despised, while French wines and manufactures
suit us very well. Nor should we scorn the profit
that comes to us therefrom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may all be,&rdquo; said Irmy; &ldquo;everything in its
proper place and manner; but as to your liking for
the French, it does not please me. We are still citizens
of the German Empire; and deeply as the house
of Austria has injured us, we should not forget from
what stock we spring, and that cat and dog will
sooner be friends than a German and a Frenchman.
In individual cases it might happen,&mdash;there are good
men in both countries,&mdash;but in our hearts and in
our politics we shall never be one with France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something may be said on that point also,&rdquo; replied
Iseli. &ldquo;What of the Duchy of Burgundy? Are not
French and Germans united there under one rule?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, my friend; but if you think it is a voluntary
union you greatly err. Nothing but the
iron hand of Charles the Bold holds them together.
They would separate in an instant, should the
powerful Duke chance to close his eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;at least,&rdquo; said Iseli, &ldquo;I am glad to find
you are an admirer of this great man, who appears
to me like a rising star in the firmament of the
world&rsquo;s history.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>This conversation had brought them back to the
gate of the good city of Basle, and at the first turning
the friends took a kindly leave of each other, their
difference of opinion having no effect upon a friendship
which had united them for years. Walter was
full of curiosity and interest. He wanted to hear
more of Charles the Bold, and besieged his father
with questions till he could stand it no longer and
sent the boy to bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">At The Bears</span></h2>
<p>An unwonted stir pervaded the
streets of Basle, as if some festival were
being celebrated. No signs of traffic
were visible, and the people were in
holiday attire. The streets were full of strangers,
who were easily distinguished by the curious glances
with which they regarded the houses and public
buildings; while at every corner burghers might
be seen directing men-at-arms with swords at their
sides through the maze of narrow lanes.</p>
<p>Two horsemen slowly made their way through
the throng, the foremost of whom wore the uniform
of an officer and displayed the badge of the Duke
of Burgundy. The other, a few paces behind, was
a groom. At length they reined in their steeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho there! my friend,&rdquo; cried the officer in good
Swiss dialect to a citizen, &ldquo;can you direct me to an
inn called The Bears?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, truly, sir,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;you have
only to ride up this street, then turn to the right;
again to the left at the next cross street, and you
cannot miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the officer as he rode off
followed by his servant, the horses carefully picking
their way over the rough pavement, through the
centre of which a row of large stones had been laid.
Indeed, it was scarcely safe for the riders themselves
to leave the middle of the passageway, for long
iron bars protruded from the houses, bearing signs
denoting the trade of their occupants, such as glass
work for a glazier, the horseshoe for a smith, and
the key for a locksmith. At one place the signboard
of an alehouse almost carried away the officer&rsquo;s iron
helm. They turned to the right and then to the
left, according to their directions, and found themselves
in a street somewhat wider than the rest,
where they soon discovered The Bears, a new and
well-built tavern, over the door of which hung a
sign emblazoned with the beasts that gave the inn
its name. A serving man sprang from the huge
gateway to assist the officer to dismount, and led his
horse away to the stables, while the host himself,
Ulrich Iseli, came forward to escort his guest up
the stairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is a fine place you have here,&rdquo; said the
latter. &ldquo;Inns like this, whether Swiss or German,
are seldom to be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right, sir,&rdquo; replied the landlord.
&ldquo;I conduct my business after the French fashion.
Having been much in Paris in my younger days, I
learned how distinguished guests should be accommodated;
and I try to keep my own house accordingly.
Will you go to the public room for the time
being? The private parlor is unfortunately occupied
by some deputies from the various Swiss
States who are holding a council there, and they
would doubtless be ill pleased were I to bring a
stranger in upon them. A chamber shall be made
ready for you at once. I have a houseful of guests,
to be sure, but room shall be found for you, depend
on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed open the door of the public room.
&ldquo;Here, Werni!&rdquo; he called to a servant, who was
engaged at that moment in delivering one of the
latest patriotic songs to a number of country people,
who crowded about him with shouts of applause,
&ldquo;come and place yourself at this gentleman&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;
Then, taking leave of the newcomer, he hastened
away to see about a lodging for his guest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The officer&rsquo;s attendant soon appeared, bringing
his master&rsquo;s luggage, and after depositing it in the
neatly appointed room assigned to him, went back
to the stables, where, ranged in long rows, stood a
hundred horses enjoying their fodder. When the
latest arrival had also been provided for, the groom
betook himself to the public room, where he found
his master already partaking of a good breakfast.
The officer ordered something to be brought for
him at once, and he modestly seated himself at
another table where two Burgundian soldiers were
vainly endeavoring to enjoy the sour Swiss wine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it was getting very noisy up in the private
parlor, the envoys disagreeing violently in their
views regarding France, Germany, and Burgundy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are sent here,&rdquo; declared Hans V&ouml;geli, the
deputy from Freiburg, &ldquo;to welcome the Emperor in
the name of our country. What is it to us what
schemes he may be entertaining? Let him answer
for those himself. We will defend our own lives if
they attempt to meddle with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is what you are always saying,&rdquo; objected
another of the envoys, who was said to be secretly
in the pay of the King of France. &ldquo;I claim that it
is far from being a matter of indifference to us
whether the Emperor and Burgundy agree or no.
Think of the force they could assemble on our borders,
and the Burgundian is a violent man. It
would almost seem that he intended to insult us by
sending the Governor, Hagenbach, hither to welcome
the Emperor in his name, for he must know
how we hate him. Did you hear of the insulting
speech Hagenbach made against the Bernese? He
declared he would strip the skins from their bears to
keep himself warm therein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those were indeed insolent words,&rdquo; declared
the deputies from Berne, &ldquo;and he shall yet make
amends to us for them. Moreover we will make
complaint of him to the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much good will that do!&rdquo; retorted the lame
magistrate, Heinrich Hassfurter, of Lucerne. &ldquo;In
truth you had best be on your guard against this
Hagenbach. I had somewhat to do with him at
Salz, when I was sent there a short time ago to
negotiate certain matters. What think you? He
declared scornfully that the Confederates must lack
able-bodied men, since they made envoys of cripples
and hunchbacks! &lsquo;That I am a cripple,&rsquo; I answered,
&lsquo;is the will of God; but I shall yet prove myself
able-bodied enough for you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, be not so sure,&rdquo; interposed another, &ldquo;that
the Emperor is in league with Burgundy. It is
true indeed that he would gladly marry his son
Maximilian<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
to the Duke&rsquo;s only daughter Maria for
the sake of acquiring Burgundy as her marriage
portion, but Charles the Bold asks too much in
return. To be King of Burgundy is not enough;
he would fain extend his kingdom to the banks of
the Rhine and claim as his own Alsace and Lorraine,
which he now holds in fee only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is shameful,&rdquo; yet another declared, &ldquo;the way
the Alsatians are treated. A worse Governor than
Hagenbach could not be found; and to add to that,
the Duke employs none but foreign mercenaries
there, who abuse the people cruelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many Switzers also among them,&rdquo;
said Hans V&ouml;geli; &ldquo;indeed my runaway brother
Heinrich is said to command a body of Hagenbach&rsquo;s
soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is disgraceful,&rdquo; cried old Hassfurter, &ldquo;that
so many Switzers should desert their own land to
seek service in foreign armies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who can blame them for it?&rdquo; replied Iseli the
innkeeper. &ldquo;Are they to sit idle here at home and
increase the number of those who find it hard
enough already to gain a livelihood in this impoverished
land? What would have become of your
brother, Herr V&ouml;geli, had he stayed at home? I do
not know the gentleman myself, it is true, but
travellers have told me that he is popular among
the Alsatians, and stands high in the favor, not only
of Hagenbach, but also of Duke Charles himself.
It is well known to foreign princes that there are no
more loyal people to be found than we Switzers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we well know,&rdquo; burst out Vogeli, &ldquo;that
these foreign lords never repay our loyalty. French,
Burgundian, or Austrian, they would not long keep
their hands off us, had they not so great a respect
for our ability to protect ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true,&rdquo; asked a deputy, seeking to put an
end to the discussion, &ldquo;that the Emperor and the
Burgundians are to unite in an expedition against
the Turks?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;So it is said,&rdquo; replied old Hassfurter, &ldquo;but who
can tell whether it will come to pass? You know
how vacillating the Emperor is, and it is certain
Charles the Bold will not join him in this enterprise,
unless he be made King; and that the princes
of the Empire will not consent to, for fear that
the Electorate of Treves and other portions of
their domains might be included in the new
kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more I say,&rdquo; interrupted V&ouml;geli, &ldquo;that all
this is nothing to us. Let the princes do as they
will; we are a free and independent people, and
should take no part in their affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we already belong to the German Empire,&rdquo;
some one objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; retorted V&ouml;geli; &ldquo;but that does not
compel us to comply with all the Emperor&rsquo;s demands.
Let us not burn our fingers meddling
with things that do not concern the safety of the
Confederation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a poor citizen,&rdquo; said old Hassfurter,
&ldquo;who will not help to extinguish the fire that is consuming
his neighbor&rsquo;s house. If the Burgundians
treat Alsace in this manner, it will not be long
before they attempt to crush us also. Might we
not be added to the kingdom that is to be formed
for Charles the Bold?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Thus the discussion went on, while below in
the large public room the country folk who had
assembled from far and near discussed the same subjects
after their own fashion. Coarse as these peasants
were in appearance, their great size and strength
lent them an air of proud self-consciousness, and
they wore their patched hose and jerkins and heavy
hobnailed shoes with as much dignity as many a
nobleman his silken doublet. Here, too, the conversation
soon became heated, and frequent hostile
glances were cast toward the Burgundian officer as
well as his servant and the two soldiers at the other
table; some even hummed to themselves the song
Werni had been singing&mdash;which contained various
contemptuous allusions to Burgundy and its Duke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>These soldiers, who from their appearance might
have been Switzers also, were in uniforms of fine
gray cloth. They seemed to ignore the scoffs and
jeers of the peasants, and as if in defiance of them,
turned the sleeves of their jerkins about to show
more plainly the badge of the Duke of Burgundy,
a pair of dice, displaying the two spots and the five
spots. At length, however, as the peasants became
more and more audacious, one of the two imitated the
lowing of a heifer. This form of insult was familiar
to the Switzers and roused them to instant fury. One
tall fellow rose, and crossing over to the table where
the men in gray were sitting, intentionally stumbled
over the legs of one of them, and assailed him with
a torrent of abuse. The soldier merely shrugged
his shoulders indifferently, which seemed to infuriate
the peasant still more; with legs outspread, he
planted himself before the Burgundian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly!&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;that is a curious ornament
you have there on your sleeve! Perchance
there was not cloth enough and your lord put those
dice on for patches!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scoundrel!&rdquo; burst out the man in gray,
&ldquo;I will teach you respect for my noble master&rsquo;s
arms; and as for patches, look at your own jerkin,
you B&auml;renh&auml;uter<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bold mountaineer looked abashed, and was
about to turn away without reply, when another
Switzer strode to his side. &ldquo;And those French
words above your noble master&rsquo;s arms, what do
they signify?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Je guette</i>,&rdquo; replied the Burgundian; &ldquo;that is
to say, &lsquo;I watch.&rsquo; One could hardly expect cow-herds
to understand French.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you shall not watch long for a flogging!&rdquo;
shouted the Switzer furiously. &ldquo;Up, all who call
themselves men! We will soon put a stop to his
insolence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good friend,&rdquo; said the other, slowly drawing his
sword, &ldquo;take your milking stool between your horns
and get you gone, else I will hack that hide of
yours till it looks as patched as your jerkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I a bull,&rdquo; roared the herdsman, &ldquo;that I
should have horns to carry a milk stool? You shall
pay dearly for that, you dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the officer brought the flat blade
of his sword down upon the table with such a clang
that all turned to look at him. He sternly bade
the soldiers hold their peace and ordered them from
the room. But the passions of the Switzers were
now fully aroused. One of them seized a heavy
oaken stool. &ldquo;Here, you good for naught!&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;take this milking stool between your
horns!&rdquo; and dashed it violently at the head of the
Burgundian. At the same instant the officer flung
himself between the combatants just in time to
receive the full weight of the blow, which stretched
him bleeding on the floor. A wild tumult at once
arose that speedily brought the landlord to the spot,
closely followed by a throng of curious deputies.
Peace was at once restored, and the Burgundians
with Iseli rushed to the relief of the victim, Hans
V&ouml;geli following.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried the latter suddenly, &ldquo;it is
my brother Heinrich. I might have known the
vagabond would come to some such end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shame!&rdquo; said old Hassfurter, &ldquo;to speak in
such a way of your own brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, preach not to me,&rdquo; retorted V&ouml;geli; &ldquo;this
man who lies here before us is no longer my brother.
I long ago cast him from my heart, and the city of
Freiburg has banished all who did not return when
they were summoned thither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was no loss to you, methinks,&rdquo; answered
Hassfurter, &ldquo;since you thereby acquired sole possession
of your father&rsquo;s house and properties, to
which otherwise Heinrich would have been entitled
to a share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried V&ouml;geli furiously; &ldquo;all the
world knows that my father had already disinherited
Heinrich.&rdquo; The old man made no reply. He
knelt down by the wounded officer, and after carefully
examining his injury shook his head gravely,
to the innkeeper&rsquo;s great alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Merciful Heaven!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the town guard
will soon be here, and I shall be punished for permitting
this affray in my house. Hagenbach, too,
will not fail to remember what has happened here to
his officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no friend?&rdquo; asked Hassfurter; &ldquo;I
mean one on whom you can rely, who would take
care of this fellow for you? As for the Burgundians,
gold will keep them silent concerning the affair.
They are not altogether guiltless themselves, and
would not escape punishment if the facts were
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have indeed such a friend,&rdquo; replied the innkeeper
in a tone of relief, &ldquo;Hans Irmy, a magistrate
of our town. Our places adjoin, and we can
easily carry the man thither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The peasants lent willing aid, and Irmy gladly
offered the use of a secret room in his house to the
wounded officer. There he lay unconscious for three
days; but nature finally triumphed, and his progress
toward recovery was rapid, thanks to Walter, Irmy&rsquo;s
son, who tended him with the greatest care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not please me,&rdquo; said the father one day,
&ldquo;that you should sit the whole day at that foreign
soldier&rsquo;s bedside; such service could be performed
quite as well by the servants.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; cried Walter, &ldquo;he is such a fine
fellow and can tell such splendid tales of war and
the battles he has fought in. It almost makes one
long to go away with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the stranger suggested that to you?&rdquo; asked
Irmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not he,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;but Iseli, your
friend, is always saying that I might make a great
success if I were to go out into the world; he seems
to think there is something unusual about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iseli is a fool,&rdquo; growled the old man, &ldquo;to put
such ideas into your head. Stay in your own
country and earn an honest living, that is my advice;
and if you must be a soldier, no doubt there will be
opportunities enough for you to begin your career
in the service of the Fatherland, instead of entering
that of any foreign prince.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Crestfallen, Walter slipped away, but half an hour
later he was sitting beside the officer again, listening
with eager interest to his tales. Heini S&uuml;ssbacher
was often in the sick chamber also, and the two
boys soon determined to follow their hero out into
the world to seek their fortunes. Not long after
this the Captain took leave of the Councillor, with
kindly thanks for his hospitality, and set out for
Treves to join the Governor, who had already
reached Strassburg with the Emperor. He was a
considerable distance away from Basle, when suddenly
the lads sprang out from the roadside and
besought him to take them with him to the ducal
court that they too might become soldiers like himself,
promising to do their best. Heinrich V&ouml;geli
reproved them sharply; but what was he to do with
them, as they absolutely refused to return home even
if he sent them away? There seemed no alternative
except to take them along. At the next town, therefore,
he hired two horses for them, that the journey
to Strassburg might be more quickly accomplished,
and also despatched a messenger secretly to old Irmy
to reassure him as to his son&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>But old Irmy was not to be appeased so easily;
he stormed and grumbled continually about the runaways.
&ldquo;And Heini, too,&rdquo; he always ended with,
&ldquo;that rascal! as if his father had not already injured
me enough in my business by selling his goods at a
loss, that he must now lead my son astray, the only
child I have in the world, and induce him to become
a vagabond and a traitor like that V&ouml;geli!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>But as week after week passed and the boys did
not return, the Councillor at length determined,
come what might, to go in search of them; he set
out also for Treves, where in a few days the
Emperor Frederick, with his son Maximilian and
Duke Charles the Bold, was to make his formal
entry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Entry of the Princes</span></h2>
<p>Irmy&rsquo;s journey was not accomplished so
easily as he had expected; he was frequently
obliged to wait, as all the horses obtainable were
needed for the use of those travellers who, as
members of the Emperor&rsquo;s household or as envoys
or functionaries of the Empire, could claim first consideration.
Nor was this a small matter, for fully
seven hundred deputies from the various cities assembled
at Treves to greet the Emperor, all of noble
birth, not to mention the curiosity-seekers.</p>
<p>It was late in the evening of the twenty-ninth
of September when the Councillor at last entered
Treves. The Emperor had already arrived that
morning, and the city was so crowded with strangers
that only by paying a large sum was Irmy able to
secure even the poorest kind of a lodging. Charles
the Bold was expected to appear the following morning,
when the Emperor was to ride out to meet him,
and the people were eagerly looking forward to the
coming spectacle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is there I shall be most likely to find the lad,&rdquo;
thought Irmy. &ldquo;I will rise early and go out to
meet the procession; V&ouml;geli will be with the Duke,
and wherever he is, Walter will surely not be far
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was the first to awake in the house the next
morning; quickly rising, he peered out through the
round leaded window panes, as well as their dinginess
would permit, at the gray sky above. &ldquo;Everything
is dirty here,&rdquo; he growled&mdash;&ldquo;the bed and the furniture
as well as the room; and these panes might
be any color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung open the sash in a rage and thrust
his head out into the cool morning air. Nothing
was stirring as yet in the street below, and he might
still have enjoyed several hours of slumber without
losing anything; but anxiety for his only child had
disturbed his natural serenity of mind and made him
restless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I can make my way through the town
easily,&rdquo; he thought. He dressed himself and went
carefully down the dark stairs of his lodging house,
the garret of which had never before been honored
by a guest of Irmy&rsquo;s wealth and standing. When
he reached the sidewalk he looked up once more at
the dark gray sky, then took his way through the
deserted streets that re&euml;choed to the sound of his
footsteps. No one was in sight but a watchman
pacing his rounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an old city,&rdquo; said Irmy to himself, &ldquo;and
not so badly built, but it cannot compare with
Basle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the gate of the town, a small fee procured him
ready egress, and the guards showed him the way to
the camp that had been pitched for the Duke and
his followers. Slowly he wandered about among
the tents, sure that here he must find his son,
since Hagenbach and his officers had already taken
possession of the quarters assigned to them as part
of the Duke&rsquo;s retinue. As yet, however, all was still
both without and within the tents, and the Councillor
turned his steps toward a sutler&rsquo;s wine shop,
on the wooden front of which was a large shield
bearing in Italian the name and calling of its occupant.
A servant with black hair and unmistakably
Italian cast of countenance was brushing away the
dried leaves from before the door and strewing the
path with white sand. Addressing him in his own
tongue, Irmy asked for a breakfast of meat, bread,
and porridge, with a draught of good wine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;I ought not to give you anything,&rdquo; replied the
Italian, &ldquo;since you are not of the Burgundian soldiery
nor yet in the Duke&rsquo;s service, it is plain. But
since none of the soldiers are stirring, belike you may
enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This the Councillor gladly did, and to pass the
time chatted with the friendly waiter, who had been
much in Venice and Genoa in former days, and
knew of many of the great mercantile houses with
which he was connected. He asked him about two
lads who must have arrived in camp with one of
the Burgundian captains, but the Lombard could
tell him nothing of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came hither with some Italian cuirassiers,
levied for Duke Charles in Italy,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and
know nothing of his other followers. But if you
will station yourself by the roadside against yonder
tree, no part of the procession can escape you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time signs of life began to appear about
the camp. Tents were thrown open here and there,
and the soldiers could be seen busied with the various
offices of their toilet. But none had any news to give
of V&ouml;geli and the two boys. One man remembered
that the Captain had been sent to Basle, but further
than that he knew nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Soon a trumpeter emerged from one of the tents
and sounded a call, whereat the whole camp instantly
sprang to life. All was bustle and activity
as each man bestirred himself to make ready for the
day&mdash;a more difficult task than usual, for on this
occasion everything must appear at its very best.
The cuirassiers had already burnished their arms and
mail to spotless brilliancy on the previous day, but
there still remained more to be done than could well
be accomplished in the short time left them. Swiftly
they rubbed down the horses, standing in long rows
tethered to a rope. The horses of the Italians were
magnificent creatures, and each was the individual
property of its rider. These cuirassiers were for
the most part men of quality; each was entitled to a
mounted esquire and one foot-soldier as his escort.
None but the rich were permitted to join their
ranks; and many nobles, survivors of the old
knighthood, were to be found serving in this troop
of mercenaries, whose pay was at least thrice that of
a lieutenant in these days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>At length all was finished, and it was an imposing
array that rode past the wine shop toward the high-road
along which the train of the Emperor was
already seen approaching. A band of drummers
and musicians led the way, and next, preceded by
waving banners and pennons, came Frederick himself,
followed by a long and brilliant cavalcade,
among which Irmy looked in vain for V&ouml;geli.
Hagenbach was there indeed; but even had the
merchant forced himself to ask for the Captain he
would have met with no reply from the haughty
Governor, who, riding to-day in attendance on the
Emperor, looked even more arrogant and pompous
than usual. The Burgundian cuirassiers brought
up the rear of the procession, during the passage of
which Irmy maintained the position pointed out
to him, beside the tree, which afforded him an
excellent view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>By this time he was no longer the only spectator.
Crowds had been pouring out from the gates of the
city and assembling from all the surrounding villages,
until the whole road on both sides was lined
with sightseers. For hours they waited cheerfully
while the two princes, who had met after half an
hour&rsquo;s ride, were engaged in a friendly dispute over
a question of honor. Frederick wished the Duke
to ride at his side, while Charles insisted that he
as the lesser potentate should modestly follow. At
length the heavens, which had lowered for a full
hour upon this ceremonious pretence, opened their
flood gates and deluged Duke and Emperor, noble
and henchman alike; for Nature at such times is
no respecter of persons. Especially inopportune
was it now, however, for all were in their most
sumptuous array; and many looked upon it as an
evil omen.</p>
<p>But sunshine followed close upon the rain, and
fair weather smiled upon their entry into the city,
their approach to which was greeted by a clashing
peal of bells from every church tower, and heralded
by the blare of trumpets and the rattle of drums long
before anything could be seen of the procession.
On it came at last,&mdash;first, the musicians, then a long
train of archers brought by the Duke of Somerset
from England, with whose royal house Charles the
Bold was connected through his wife. These were
followed by a group of heralds. And now, amid
the deafening shouts and acclamations of the multitude,
appeared the Emperor and the Duke, riding
side by side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Old Irmy&rsquo;s somewhat elevated position enabled
him to look over the heads of the intervening
spectators. That rider glittering with gold and
jewels, his embroidered doublet thickly set with
pearls, sitting his horse so stooped and carelessly&mdash;the
man with the listless, indifferent expression and
heavy, protruding under lip&mdash;could he be the ruler
of the Holy Roman Empire? Alas! what could
be hoped for from one whose utter lack of strength
and firmness was so evident? It was far pleasanter
to look on the youthful figure behind him, the
Grand Duke Maximilian, whose handsome and
intelligent face was framed with a mass of fair
curling hair. Clad all in velvet and silver, he rode
between the Archbishops of Mayence and Treves.
Accompanying these Princes of the Church was a
singular companion, designated by the onlookers as
&ldquo;the Turk.&rdquo; This was a son of the Sultan, who
had been taken captive by the Christians and
received the baptismal name of Calixtus. He lived
at the Austrian court and was fond of appearing in
costumes of startling gorgeousness. These personages
did not claim attention long, however, for all
eyes quickly turned to the centre of interest, the
man who rode at the Emperor&rsquo;s side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Charles the Bold could certainly never have been
called handsome, whatever his flatterers might claim;
but fire and energy gleamed in his dark eyes, proud
self-confidence, inflexible will, and haughty defiance
were stamped upon his countenance. The personality
of the Prince denoted an overbearing imperiousness
that seemed to challenge at once admiration
and repugnance, affection and antipathy. Magnificent,
indeed, was the Duke&rsquo;s attire. Over the
breastplate of polished steel he wore a cloak so
covered with pearls, diamonds, and rubies that the
merchant from Basle estimated its value at two
hundred thousand gold florins, while in his velvet
cap sparkled a single jewel that was priceless. The
Duke&rsquo;s charger also called forth universal admiration.
It was a black horse of matchless strength
and beauty, equipped in full mail and decked with
gold and jewelled housings that swept the ground.
Behind the princes followed a long train of German
and Burgundian nobles, among them the privy
councillors of the Emperor and of the Duke, and
the envoys of Albert of Brandenburg, who was
called Achilles.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why is he not there himself?&rdquo; the people asked
of one another; &ldquo;he is deemed the bravest and wisest
prince in all the Empire, and they say the Emperor
can do nothing without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How think you,&rdquo; asked another, &ldquo;it would
please the Elector to ride modestly behind the
Burgundian among all those princes and counts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seemed no end to the cavalcade. Following
the Duke&rsquo;s bodyguard, all sumptuously arrayed,
both horse and man, came the flower of the Burgundian
army, every man clad in new and glittering
armor, their banners floating above them in the
blaze of the Autumn sunlight, the whole making a
scene of splendor such as the people had never
before beheld. Pennon after pennon passed old
Irmy, and still the end was not yet in sight, although
the two princes had already entered the market place
in Treves. There a second discussion arose between
them as to which should have the honor of escorting
the other to his lodgings, the Emperor as governor
of the city wishing to act the part of host, and the
Duke protesting. At length they agreed to separate
at the market place, and the Duke rode at full speed
back to the gates, which the last of his followers were
just entering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Once more the Duke passed Irmy while on his
way to the Abbey of Saint Maximin, of which his
ancestors had been patrons, and where he had taken
up his quarters rather than in the town. This time,
however, he rode too swiftly, and the people were
too full of all the sights they had seen for him to
excite the attention that he had received half an
hour before. His retinue, the English archers,
the Italian cuirassiers, and the native Burgundians
with their varied equipment, followed through the
gates. Six culverins were also included in the train,
mounted on the wooden carriages which the Duke
was accustomed to carry with him in the field, and
which had been set up here in the camp also.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Dejected and disheartened, the old man turned
his steps toward the camp once more. He had
seen nothing of Captain V&ouml;geli nor of his son, and
had small hope of finding them here now. Exhausted
with the fatigues of the day, and faint with
hunger, for he had eaten nothing since morning, his
first thought was to seek rest and refreshment, and
then continue his search. Slowly he walked on
through the camp. Artisans of all sorts had set up
their workshops near the tents, bakers and butchers
were offering their wares for sale, and there were
tap-houses by the dozen. The cuirassiers had
removed the trappings from their horses and with
handfuls of straw were busy rubbing the foam and
sweat from their flanks. The Italian&rsquo;s hospitable
wine shop stood open; but the tables were already
well filled with soldiers, and the Councillor was
about to pass on when the friendly servant beckoned
to him and, leading him around to the rear, whispered:
&ldquo;This way; enter with me and seat yourself
behind the counter; the soldiers will take you for one
of us and make no objection to your presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tired and hungry Irmy gladly followed this
suggestion. A good and substantial meal revived
his strength; but his unwonted exertions proved
too much for him, and he offered the waiter a good
sum if he would provide him with a place where he
might rest for a short time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come right in here, sir,&rdquo; replied the Italian,
leading him to a small compartment; &ldquo;you can lie
down on my bed and no one will disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Lost Found</span></h2>
<p>As old Irmy slept, the wine shop gradually
filled, while in the large tavern room the
landlord was kept equally busy supplying
the Burgundian officers with wine, cards,
and dice. Duke Charles would permit no gambling
among the common soldiers, and regarded it with
great disfavor for the officers also; but to-day the
players had no fear of discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are on duty to-day, V&ouml;geli?&rdquo; asked one
of the men from Freiburg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that is why I was not in the procession.
It is a pity I was forced to miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, waste no regrets on that,&rdquo; was the answer;
&ldquo;between dust and sweat we almost perished. What
say you,&mdash;shall we have a game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not care much for play,&rdquo; replied V&ouml;geli,
&ldquo;but as you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They seated themselves accordingly and began to
play, while the other tables were lively with all
kinds of sport.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;why the Duke sent
that magnificent diamond ring to his new page?
Faith, it was because he wished the Prince good luck
in his pursuit of Fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All do not get such rich rewards,&rdquo; said another;
&ldquo;the Duke is often displeased by such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember Lord de Comines?&rdquo; asked
a third; &ldquo;he stood high in Charles&rsquo;s favor, was his
private secretary, and presumed more than any
favorite ever had dared, yet even he once excited
the wrath of the Duke. After a banquet, one night,
he bethought him &rsquo;twould be a rare jest to sleep off
his drunkenness in his master&rsquo;s bed. But Charles
soon awakened him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good friend,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you have forgotten
your boots,&rsquo; and kneeling down he drew them off
himself; then he flung them at the head of the now
sobered secretary, and ordered him from the room
to finish his slumbers in his own bed. Comines
was known ever after as &lsquo;Puss in Boots,&rsquo; and was
received with scoffs and jeers whenever he ventured
to show his face. Now he hobnobs in Paris with
King Louis and weaves intrigues against us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>V&ouml;geli had been winning steadily, and not wishing
to take any more of his comrade&rsquo;s money, he arose
and left the tavern to attend to his duties as officer
of the day. Meanwhile it had been getting very
noisy in the wine shop. The good Burgundy dispensed
by Giacomo, the host, was greatly enjoyed
by the cuirassiers, and they applied themselves to it
industriously. Here, too, dice were thrown and
cards dealt, but with more caution than the officers
displayed. At length the door opened and six
English archers entered, who quietly took their
places at a table and called for wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What business have they here?&rdquo; asked the
cuirassiers of one another. &ldquo;Giacomo, you are our
sutler and shall serve no others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the tavernkeeper paid no heed to this, however,
but prepared to supply the wants of the newcomers,
one of the esquires, a Lombard of graceful
but almost boyish figure sprang up from a table.
&ldquo;Hark you, Giacomo!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;if you dare
to serve these English curs we will run you through
and afterwards burn your shop over your head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This threat was approved by loud shouts and
vigorous oaths from all sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All honor to my countrymen!&rdquo; said the Italian,
deprecatingly, &ldquo;but the English must also live; nor
do they lack good gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nay&mdash;they have far too much, the dogs, the
slanderers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The archers meanwhile, scarcely comprehending
the import of this discourse, sat waiting patiently for
the liquor they had ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph,&rdquo; said one of them to his neighbor, &ldquo;can
you make out what that little devil yonder is saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never a word,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I only know I
have a precious thirst and am kept waiting too long
for my wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With some difficulty the host succeeded in making
his way to the Englishmen&rsquo;s table; but before
he could set down the jugs two Lombards planted
themselves before him and shouted threateningly:
&ldquo;The Devil take you, Giacomo! Give them nothing,
or it shall be the worse for you, do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Giacomo lost his patience. &ldquo;Nay, go to
the Devil yourselves, dear countrymen,&rdquo; he retorted,
&ldquo;or whither you please! As for me, the Englishmen&rsquo;s
gold is as good as your own. Give way!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>By this time the archers had grasped the situation,
for they had been once praised by the Duke and
held up as examples to the disorderly Lombards,
who ever since had been their bitter enemies;
and when the two cuirassiers proceeded to knock
the jugs from Giacomo&rsquo;s hand, spilling the wine
upon the floor, Ralph with another tall archer
sprang up, seized them by the throat in their iron
grasp, and hurled them against the door with such
violence that it burst open, and the Lombards
rolled out head over heels just at the feet of Captain
V&ouml;geli, who was making his rounds through the
camp to see that all was in order. This unexpected
encounter was far from pleasing to the cuirassiers, for
any breach of peace was severely punished. They
attempted to explain, but the uproar within was so
great, V&ouml;geli did not stop to listen. Hastily entering
the tavern he found the Englishmen surrounded
on all sides with threatening fists and gleaming knives.
Instant silence followed his appearance, for the
strictness of the Duke&rsquo;s discipline was well known
among his followers, and the officer of the day was
therefore a person much to be feared. Each man
gave a different account of what had happened;
but as all agreed that the two Lombards who had
been flung out of the door and who by this time
had picked themselves up out of the dust were the
chief offenders, the Captain concluded to keep the
affair to himself for this once, and merely ordered
the archers to leave the wine shop. Before they
had departed, however, the door of the servant&rsquo;s
sleeping-room opened and old Irmy made his appearance,
roused at last by all the commotion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;What! you here at last?&rdquo; exclaimed V&ouml;geli,
holding out his hand to greet the merchant.
&ldquo;Truly you have kept us waiting long. But how
came you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is no concern of yours,&rdquo; growled Irmy,
refusing the proffered hand. &ldquo;Where is my child,
whom you enticed away from me in return for the
hospitality I showed you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good sir,&rdquo; said the officer, &ldquo;&rsquo;twas but in
kindness to your friend, the host of The Bears,
that you took me in, for it would have fared ill
with him had news of that affair become known.
As for your son, nothing was farther from my
thoughts than to persuade him to leave you. I did
not believe the lad would return to his home even
had I refused to take him with me, and then you
might have searched for him, who knows where?
If you will go with me to the city, he shall be restored
to you at once. Moreover, I have managed
already to disgust him with the idea of soldiering.
The other youth refuses to be converted, however,
and is in a fair way to become a pikeman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;I care naught for him,&rdquo; replied Irmy, as they
left the wine shop; &ldquo;he was always a good-for-naught.
His father settled in the village of Aarau,
and thought to ruin us merchants of Basle by his
low prices; and when he finally died, himself a
bankrupt, nothing would do but I must have the
boy brought up in my house. But he never could
be taught anything; he is as full of foolish pranks
as a donkey is of gray hairs, though not altogether
bad at heart,&mdash;not so bad as his father was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you are talking sensibly,&rdquo; said V&ouml;geli.
&ldquo;Methinks you might have spared me your abuse
just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, do not judge me too harshly,&rdquo; answered the
old man; &ldquo;it is my nature to grumble, and in a
large business like mine one is vexed by so many
people every day, one becomes used to quarrelling.
Consider, too, that I had lost my only child, the
boy who is to succeed to my name and to my
business when I no longer have time or strength to
carry it on. I am glad to find him here with you,
and thank you with all my heart for the wisdom and
prudence you have shown.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Truly that has a different sound,&rdquo; declared the
officer; &ldquo;but let us turn up this street. My lodgings
are yonder on the market place, and there we shall
find the lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Irmy hurried on in advance of his companion,
till he reached the doorway of the house
V&ouml;geli had pointed out; he rushed up the stairway,
and the next moment father and son were clasped
in each other&rsquo;s arms. The Councillor&rsquo;s forgiveness
was easily won, for he had already given his anger
full vent, and when, half an hour later, the two
Irmys found themselves seated with the Captain at
the well spread table of the best inn the town afforded,
the last trace of his resentment vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to remain here with us a few days
longer and see all the festivities,&rdquo; said V&ouml;geli&mdash;&ldquo;the
tournament, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Irmy refused, declaring he must return at
once to look after his people, who would be out of
all bounds were he too long absent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a gay life you lead here,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;and one cannot much blame a lad of sixteen for
longing to join in it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;All is not gold that glitters,&rdquo; replied the Captain.
&ldquo;I often feel a distaste for my profession; indeed,
I should never have left my native land had I been
on better terms with my brother Hans. He was
always domineering and, being the elder, determined
to have his own way in everything. Moreover, he
well understood how to win over our father by his
flattery, while I with my straightforward disposition
could not get on with him at all. I was obliged to
submit myself dutifully to my brother&rsquo;s orders and
weigh raisins and pour vinegar in my father&rsquo;s grocery
shop, with no prospect of ever becoming anything
more than a clerk&mdash;for Hans always reserved the
profits for himself. So I said to myself, &lsquo;You had
better try some other country,&rsquo; and though I well
knew how deserters were despised, I left my home
and took service with Burgundy. Nor have I
reason to regret it, for in truth I have prospered
better than most. My father disinherited me, it is
true, and the city of Freiburg has banished all deserters,
but I care little for that. I willingly yield
to Hans my share of our inheritance, and should I
ever return to Freiburg to visit the graves of my
parents, as a Burgundian officer, I shall enter and
depart without question. Yet for many reasons I
do not like this service, for there is much wrong
and injustice, and it often revolts me to be forced
to obey Hagenbach&rsquo;s commands. Moreover, it is a
sad life to be always wandering among strangers,
without a country, without a home, without a family.
Here one lives from hand to mouth, and to save
enough from one&rsquo;s pay to return at last to the
Fatherland to end one&rsquo;s days in peace is scarcely to
be thought of.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not quit this service and go with us?&rdquo;
said Irmy; &ldquo;surely some place can be found for you,
in your own land, that will suit you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I am forbidden to return to Freiburg, and
you know I am a Switzer. It must go hard with
us before we abandon the masters to whom we have
pledged ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So their talk ran on till the shades of evening
began to fall, when they parted, Irmy returning with
Walter to what had hitherto been the Captain&rsquo;s
lodgings, while the latter hastened back to the camp
and took up his quarters in the tent that had been
assigned to him there.</p>
<p>On the following morning the merchant and his
son bade farewell to their friend and, riding out
through the gate of the city, took their way along
the highroad that led from Strassburg to Basle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Emperor&rsquo;s Flight</span></h2>
<p>Festivities of all sorts, tournament,
parades, and banquets followed in rapid
succession in the city of Treves. Even the
festivals of the Church afforded the clergy
an opportunity of displaying their wealth and magnificence.
The Archbishop, however, was not
altogether pleased with what was going on within
the walls of his court; for the people talked openly
of Charles&rsquo;s coronation, an event as much opposed
to the interests of the ecclesiastical Elector of
Treves as of all the princes of the German Empire.
Either the Elector of Brandenburg or the Elector of
Saxony could lay quite as just a claim to a king&rsquo;s
crown as could the Burgundian. Moreover, was it
not whispered that the Electorate of Treves was to
form part of the new kingdom? The Archbishop
a vassal of Charles the Bold! Nay, that must be
prevented at any cost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Meanwhile the negotiations between the two
potentates made little progress. Week after week
went by, and still the Councillors could come to
no agreement concerning the Turkish war, as it was
given out, but in reality, as to the marriage of
Maximilian and the coronation of Charles the Bold,
though this was known only to the initiated. At
last, however, the end seemed near: the Councillors
met to complete the final arrangements; that evening
the contracts were to be signed; and the next
morning Charles would awake as King, Maximilian
as the betrothed of Burgundy&rsquo;s heiress.</p>
<p>The Emperor reclined contentedly in his armchair.
He had been repeatedly annoyed by the Duke&rsquo;s
arrogance and extravagance of display, but comforted
himself with the reflection that all Charles&rsquo;s
wealth and possessions would eventually fall to his
own son and heir by marriage with the much
courted Maria of Burgundy. That here in this
old city events were to prove propitious to him had
been foretold by the stars. His entry had been
made under a fortunate conjunction, and since then
there had been no change in the favorable aspect of
the planets. Yet he could not permit this night to
pass without again consulting the heavens as to the
further progress of his affairs. Rising listlessly, therefore,
from the writing table upon which he was wont
to scribble and had to-day scrawled with especial
conviction fully a hundred times the words, &ldquo;The
whole earth is a vassal of Austria,&rdquo; he was about to
seek a private conference with the court astrologer,
when a light knock was heard at the door, and the
venerable Archbishop of Treves entered, evidently
in great agitation. Approaching the Emperor, he
bowed respectfully and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;May a faithful servant crave leave to speak a
few words with Your Majesty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were about to retire,&rdquo; replied Frederick
indifferently, &ldquo;but will not refuse you, if it be on a
matter of great import.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not otherwise, sire, would I have presumed to
intrude myself in the chamber of our most illustrious
Emperor,&rdquo; said the Archbishop. Then standing
erect before the monarch and assuming a resolute
expression, he began:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;For many weeks past, in our good city of
Treves, great preparations have been made both in
the cathedral and on the market place, and people
in the streets talk of a coronation. The Princes and
Electors of the Empire have paid no heed to this
idle chatter, nor deemed that aught else was in question
than another of those splendid pageants of which
we feel we have already seen more than enough.
But reliable news has just reached us that these
rumors are not entirely without foundation, and I
have hastened hither to implore Your Majesty in
the name of my fellow-princes to put an end to our
apprehensions with one word of assurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if we cannot speak that word?&rdquo; asked
Frederick calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then God help the unhappy Empire, and the
illustrious house of Austria as well! But I can
scarce believe that His Roman Majesty has formed
a decision or pledged himself as yet in so weighty an
affair as this. To create a King without a council
of the chief members of the Empire! That were
unheard of. But no! pardon me, Your Majesty,
if I have gone too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, go on,&rdquo; replied the Emperor. &ldquo;What
you say is nothing new. All these objections have
been laid before us a thousand times by our loyal
subject and Privy Councillor, Count Werdenberg.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Thus encouraged, Archbishop John continued:
&ldquo;Were it merely the question of a new kingdom, of
what countries would you form it? Powerful princes
of the Church forced to submit to Burgundian
sovereignty? Lorraine?&mdash;I cannot believe you
would wrest that from the knightly young Duke
Ren&eacute;. Nay, should Your Imperial Majesty permit
such a crime against a minor, &rsquo;twould justify the
pettiest freebooter&rsquo;s unlawful depredations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Frederick looked away, unable to meet the
stern glance of the prelate, who continued: &ldquo;And
in the end, even should Your Majesty succeed, contrary
to all precedent, in forming a new kingdom,
and making the proud Burgundian your ally, would
not all his enemies and backbiters then become the
foes of Austria likewise? I beseech Your Majesty
to consider: cut off from all the members of the
Empire, menaced by foes from without, the Lord of
Christendom will be forced to yield to the commands
or desires of the King he has created.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may all be true,&rdquo; answered Frederick,
quite unmoved; &ldquo;but since you discourse so sagely
of these things mayhap you can show us some
way out of the tangle; for ourselves, we can find
none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing easier,&rdquo; returned the Archbishop.
&ldquo;Speak of this to no one: at midnight we will take
a boat and depart secretly from Treves. You will
thus escape from your dilemma. Duke Charles will
not be crowned, the Empire will suffer no wrong, and
Your Majesty will be freed from all obligations and
once more master of your own actions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Frederick was speechless with surprise, but after
some deliberation he agreed to follow this counsel.
An emissary was secretly despatched to the Imperial
Councillors, who were still arguing with the Burgundians.
To the amazement of the latter, Count
Werdenberg suddenly declared negotiations broken
off, nor were all their efforts to secure a future
resumption of the discussion of any avail. Half
an hour later the Burgundian Chancellor stood beside
the Duke&rsquo;s bed in the Abbey of St. Maximin and
related what had passed, his report being frequently
interrupted by outbursts of fury from his lord.</p>
<p>Just at this time a door of the archiepiscopal
palace in Treves was softly opened and Archbishop
John issued forth followed by young Maximilian
and Frederick, with a few attendants. Silently and
cautiously they crept away and betook themselves
with all speed to the banks of the Moselle, where a
boat was waiting for them. Like fugitives the princes
silently embarked, and protected by the veil of night
that still hung heavy over the old city, the boat
glided smoothly down the dark river toward the
green waters of the Rhine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Half an hour after their departure a troop of
horsemen approached the spot where the skiff had
been moored. They were Burgundian cuirassiers,
led by Captain V&ouml;geli, who had been on guard in
the Duke&rsquo;s antechamber. &ldquo;The Devil!&rdquo; he growled,
&ldquo;could I but have carried the Roman Emperor
prisoner to my Duke, I need have yearned no longer
to end my days comfortably in the Fatherland.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Rising at Brisach</span></h2>
<p>Since the days of Tell and Gessler there
had been no alliance between Austria and
the Swiss Confederation. Occasionally, it
is true, the Swiss had shown a friendly
spirit toward the Emperor, who was a member of
that royal house, and they had never really ceased
to regard themselves as belonging to the German
Empire. About this time, however, a peace was
concluded between the two countries, called the
&ldquo;Everlasting Compact,&rdquo; which has never been
broken from that day to this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The Swiss States had advanced to the Austrian
Archduke Sigismund the sum required to redeem
his Alsatian possessions, and notified Charles the
Bold, who held them in pledge, that it was awaiting
his acceptance in Basle. But Charles continually
made evasions. While at Treves, he had visited
these mortgaged lands and concluded they would
form a valuable addition to his own dominions.
He urged the Hapsburger to defer a settlement of
the affair until he should have time to receive the
money at Besan&ccedil;on or some other designated place;
under no circumstances would he come to Basle.
This was brief and to the point; in reality he had
no notion of granting a release at any time.</p>
<p>The Alsatians themselves were far from content
with this state of things, for while Duke Sigismund
was by no means a model sovereign, the harsh rule
of Peter von Hagenbach pleased them still less.
The hated Governor resided at Brisach, and on this
particular evening had summoned all his officers to
a council. Striding restlessly up and down the spacious
apartment where a number of fierce bearded
soldiers, Walloons and Picards for the most part,
were already assembled, he at last burst out: &ldquo;Where
is that fellow V&ouml;geli? Can he mean to play us false,
as I have been warned? Pah! I know my Switzers
very well. They will lend themselves to anything,
provided they are but paid and managed properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had he uttered the words, when V&ouml;geli
entered and, passing the Governor and his fellow-officers
with a respectful greeting, took his place
at the lower end of the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Marry, sir!&rdquo; cried Hagenbach smiling, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
plain you are no fool and know how to make yourself
of importance. By right you should no longer be
entitled to share our councils, for I have released
your disorderly followers from their oath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, until they have been paid their
arrears I am still their Captain and yours,&rdquo; quietly
answered V&ouml;geli.</p>
<p>Hagenbach darted an evil glance at the bold
speaker, but made no reply, and turning at once
to the matter in hand, addressed his leaders as
follows: &ldquo;You are all well aware of the mutinous
spirit that exists among the inhabitants of this
cursed country. If we delay they will soon be in
open revolt. It is our business to maintain the
allegiance due our mighty lord, the Duke, may
God preserve him, and to seize by force whatever
towns or castles may be necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>The foreign captains here expressed their lively
approval, but V&ouml;geli was silent. Hagenbach continued:
&ldquo;What these churls have in mind is plain
from the fact that even to-day, on the holy Easter
festival, they went fully armed to church. But, by
my soul, it shall not be! This good city of Brisach
must be held for our lord at any cost. There is no
lack of provisions, and the stores would suffice for
a year were there fewer mouths to devour them.
This, then, is my plan: Early on the morrow a
proclamation shall be made to the citizens, that
their refusal to aid in the work of fortification will
avail them naught; all those who are not outside
the gates by midday prepared to labor in the
trenches shall be dragged thither by force, be they
men or women. For the execution of this order,
gentlemen, you will answer to me, and if any one
can suggest a better plan&mdash;let him speak.&rdquo; The
Governor paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, my lord,&rdquo; said V&ouml;geli deprecatingly,
&ldquo;but if the burghers are forced to do this work,
will they not return to their homes exasperated by
the indignity inflicted on them and yet more determined
upon mischief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear, my friend,&rdquo; replied Hagenbach
with a sinister smile, &ldquo;they will make no trouble for
us in Brisach, for the reason that when all are without
the walls the gates shall be closed and none
permitted to return again at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And their children and their property?&rdquo; inquired
V&ouml;geli.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;God-a-mercy! What does that concern you?
Their brats shall be sent after them, and their possessions
serve as a reward to our brave followers.
Those who stay behind shall be strung up as rebels;
and should there be too many of these, faith, our
good friend Joseph Broschi [here he nodded to
one of the officers] well understands how to dispose
of a superfluous population.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The details of this cruel scheme were listened to
in silence and without a sign of disfavor from those
present; no objections were made, for all were
accustomed to obey. Moreover, the Governor
was in the right in one respect. Only the most
extreme measures could break the rebellious spirit
of the Alsatians; so the city of Brisach must be
made a warning example. The conference therefore
was soon ended, and the captains separated with
many coarse jests. Hagenbach clapped V&ouml;geli
roughly on the shoulder, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you to-day? You are
as soft-hearted as an old woman. But hark you,
sir! I have no use for such officers, nor yet has
our lord of Burgundy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>V&ouml;geli looked inquiringly at the Governor.
&ldquo;Does that mean I am dismissed, my lord?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, methinks we shall stick together for some
time yet; for if you intend to remain in the Duke&rsquo;s
service till your men are paid, you are like to wait
till Doomsday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words Hagenbach turned abruptly to
one of the Italians, with whom he conversed for
some time in an undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep a watchful eye on him,&rdquo; said Hagenbach
to the others, as V&ouml;geli left. &ldquo;Heretofore I have
turned a deaf ear to all whispers against him; now
I no longer trust him. I will consider the matter
to-morrow. He is a good soldier, and the people
like him; but be on your guard as befits the service
of our most noble Duke.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Thoughtfully V&ouml;geli took his way back to the
dwelling of his friendly host, Hans Wild, where a
cordial reception awaited him. The children came
running out to meet the soldier guest who could
tell such fine tales of war and adventure, and hailed
him with shouts of joy; but to-night he was gloomy
and silent and paid no heed to them. Tearfully the
little ones hastened to their mother, who chided
them gently for troubling the Captain, although
she herself was concerned at his appearance, as he
moodily bade her good-evening. Woman-like, she
endeavored by kindly questioning to discover the
cause of his trouble, and abused the Governor for
denying his officers an Easter holiday, but all to no
purpose; V&ouml;geli continued in a silent and gloomy
mood. Indeed, when Frau Katharine pressed him
too closely his brow grew so dark that saucy
little Anne Marie cried out: &ldquo;Oh see, mother!
What an old growler he looks like! He is not so
nice after all. The Duke is wicked, and the Governor
is wicked, and now the Captain looks as if he
wanted to eat us all up, you and me and little
Peter too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother would have punished the child for her
pertness, but she fled for protection to V&ouml;geli, who
stroked her smooth yellow locks as he pacified Frau
Katharine. &ldquo;Children know not what they say,&rdquo;
he graciously declared. &ldquo;Alas! did we elders but
know always what was best to do or say&mdash;No!&rdquo; he
cried out suddenly, &ldquo;I will not do it, come what
may!&rdquo; And he brought his fist down on the table
with such force that the dishes rattled and Anne
Marie and her mother looked at each other in surprise.
At that moment Hans Wild, a respectable
rope-maker, entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let your family leave the room,&rdquo; commanded
V&ouml;geli sternly. &ldquo;I must speak with you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;God help us!&rdquo; wailed Frau Katharine, &ldquo;our
lives must be at stake. It is true that my good
husband went to the minister and did not lay aside
all his arms; but be merciful to him, sir! Surely he
is not more to blame than the other citizens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it be a sin to fulfil an honest man&rsquo;s duty
toward the welfare of our good city, then I am
guilty,&rdquo; said Hans calmly. &ldquo;Proceed! God sends
no man more than he can bear, and the God of our
fathers still lives, despite Hagenbach and his Duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the door was closed, V&ouml;geli approached his
host and held out his hand, saying: &ldquo;You have
a stout heart, I know; how is it with the other
citizens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hans gave him a searching glance. &ldquo;Doubtless
through you the Governor seeks to find me out and
ruin me. But this I tell you frankly: you may do
with me as you will; but when the others strike, the
blow will be a cruel one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>V&ouml;geli smiled kindly. &ldquo;Rest assured, my friend,
I mean you no harm. But since you are already so
certain of success, perchance you will not need the
aid of myself and my two hundred men&mdash;should
you come to blows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Master Hans, in astonishment,
&ldquo;do you mean that you would help us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, and without delay&mdash;to-morrow, in
truth, else it may be too late,&rdquo; replied the Captain
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow? Impossible! We are all armed,
it is true, but must wait for re&euml;nforcements from
Ensisheim and other towns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, wait, and perish! But first
listen to what I tell you. To-morrow morning you
and your wives will be driven from the city to work
in the trenches. Once gone, you with all the rest
will be forbidden to re&euml;nter the gates; if you stay
behind you will be slain. Your property will be
divided among the foreign mercenaries, and your
children perchance sent after you, should the spoilers
see fit to spare them. Take tender leave to-night
of Anne Marie and Peter. You may never see
them again, Master Hans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In answer to his anxious questions, V&ouml;geli explained
the extent and imminence of the danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would you advise us to do? We are
not yet prepared to strike,&rdquo; said Hans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Trust to our help, my friend; it shall not fail
you. Early in the morning, before the proclamation
can be published, I will go to the Governor and
once more demand of him the pay for my men. If
he refuse, as he surely will, sound the great drum
and be ready. We will take him prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is done,&rdquo; cried Hans joyfully, &ldquo;you will
have the city&rsquo;s lasting gratitude. You may depend
upon us to do our part. For some weeks we have
had a secret understanding among ourselves, so that
any news, good or bad, can be spread throughout
the town like wildfire. I will see to that, but do
not leave us in the lurch, sir Captain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>V&ouml;geli repeated his assurances, and the two men
parted with a firm hand-clasp, the one to seek his
fellow citizens, the other to kindle the increased anger
of his men, who were already quarrelling in a tavern
over their discharge.</p>
<p>The citizens spent an anxious night. Would the
morrow bring freedom or ruin?&mdash;Scarce had the
iron tongues of the bells sounded their first summons
to the faithful, when V&ouml;geli betook himself to Hagenbach&rsquo;s
quarters. The guard at the door refused to
admit him, but V&ouml;geli with one sweep of his muscular
arm hurled the man aside and walked unannounced
into the bedchamber of the Governor, who, reclining
half dressed in a deep armchair, was meditating upon
his plans for the day. His thoughts had just turned
to V&ouml;geli and he was debating whether it would not
be best to have him placed under immediate arrest,
when suddenly the Captain himself stood before
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, V&ouml;geli,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;what are
you doing here at this hour? and why do you enter
unannounced? In future wait till you are summoned.&rdquo;
The veins on his forehead swelled and
his voice shook with rage. But V&ouml;geli did not
move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be not angry with me, my lord,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
come not of my own will, nor on my own errand;
but my men will give me no peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send them to the Evil One, whose children they
are!&rdquo; roared the Governor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a hard task to get the two hundred
ready,&rdquo; retorted V&ouml;geli with seeming good-nature;
&ldquo;moreover the evil one of dice and drink, to whom I
should send them, loves full pockets, as your lordship
well knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know that, scoundrel? You are
hounding me again for your fellows&rsquo; beggarly pay.
Know, sir, that our lord Duke has not a farthing for
lukewarm or treacherous servants like yourself. But
I will give you and them the kind of pay you well
deserve!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;So? What will you give us?&rdquo; asked V&ouml;geli
deliberately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something that will proclaim you all vile curs,&rdquo;
shouted Hagenbach. &ldquo;And now begone, if
you would not have the Evil One take you
likewise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>V&ouml;geli looked steadily at the Governor. He
was inwardly raging and on the point of uttering a
fatal threat, but controlled himself in time, and
merely answered: &ldquo;May you never repent this, my
lord. I go as you command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor hurled some furious oaths after
him, then flung himself back in his chair and
pondered afresh. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twere better, methinks, had I
kept the fellow here. Who knows what mischief
he may breed?&rdquo; Sir Peter on this occasion seemed
to have lacked his wonted decision, for he hesitated
and delayed putting his scheme against the people
into execution, until much precious time had been
irrevocably lost.</p>
<p>After leaving the Governor, V&ouml;geli repaired directly
to the market place, where his followers were
anxiously awaiting him. &ldquo;Have you brought us
our pay?&rdquo; shouted one boisterous fellow, as soon
as he caught sight of the Captain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fine pay indeed,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Our noble
lord told me to send you all to the Evil One.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A storm of angry shouts arose. &ldquo;Let us go and
get it ourselves!&rdquo; yelled one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall give us a ton of gold and his life to
boot!&rdquo; cried another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; commanded V&ouml;geli. Silence ensued,
when lo, a singular spectacle presented itself. At
the beat of a drum throngs of armed citizens began
to issue from all the houses; rapidly the number
increased, being swelled by women and half-grown
lads also, bearing any sort of implement that
would serve as a weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Governor! To Hagenbach&rsquo;s quarters!&rdquo;
was the general cry. &ldquo;Long live the illustrious
House of Austria!&rdquo; and therewith the Hapsburg
banner floated lightly in the breeze. Renewed
shouts greeted the well-known emblem&mdash;&ldquo;Long
live our noble lord, Duke Sigismund! hurrah!
hurrah!&rdquo; On they moved toward their destination,
when suddenly a troop of glittering horsemen
blocked the way. They were nobles from the
surrounding country on their way to complain
to the Governor of injuries on the part of the
Burgundian officers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, in God&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; shouted the foremost
of the riders. &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live Austria! Long live Archduke Sigismund!&rdquo;
was the only response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Archduke himself would be the first to
condemn such action on your part. Bethink you
how long he has been allied to Burgundy. He is
Duke Charles&rsquo;s friend and would never countenance
any act of hostility toward him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not readily pardon the use of his name
for your unlawful purposes,&rdquo; added another of the
nobles. &ldquo;Desist, I charge you, nor presume to
lay violent hands on the Duke&rsquo;s most distinguished
officer, else you will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here his words were drowned by a roar of indignation
from the populace; and Hans Wild, raised
aloft by two of his fellow tradesmen, shouted in
ringing tones: &ldquo;Give way, my lords! You have
lent us no aid in the past, nor will we brook interference
from you now. Our crime, if such you
deem it, be on our own heads. Long live Austria,
say I, and down with the Governor!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Thundering applause greeted these words. The
horsemen fell back dismayed, and on swept the
throng. Soldiers stood in the doorways looking on
in amazement, at first unable to comprehend the
meaning of it. They had received no orders.
Access to Hagenbach&rsquo;s quarters was already cut off;
and finally, seeing what was afoot and that they
stood no chance against the infuriated citizens supported
by V&ouml;geli&rsquo;s followers, they deemed it best to
abandon the scene of their offences, and took to
their heels, singly or in small companies, without
even stopping to gather up their belongings or their
booty. The insurgents paid no heed to them,
intent only on capturing the person of the detested
Governor. He should be made to atone for all his
crimes and cruelties, and woe to him if he should
be found in his quarters!</p>
<p>Greatly to their rage and chagrin, however, the
nest was empty. Hagenbach had been warned in
time to make his escape by a side door. Could he
be already beyond their reach? The discovery of
the open wicket left no doubt as to the direction of
his flight; and some of the more active burghers,
quickly mounting, hastened in pursuit, the others,
with the soldiers, following and carefully searching
every house along the roadside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Suddenly a triumphant shout arose: &ldquo;We have
him, we have him!&rdquo; and at the same moment the
Governor, accompanied by one faithful attendant,
was seen dashing out from a farmyard. Forcing
his way through the crowd, he crossed the road
and set off at full speed across the fields, thinking
to escape that way. A lively chase followed; but
Hagenbach, who had flung himself on an ordinary
cart horse, had small chance against the better
mounted burghers, and was soon overtaken. A few
powerful but well-parried sword strokes, and he was
a prisoner. But even then his insolence did not
desert him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make haste and fling me to the bloodthirsty
dogs that they may gorge themselves! Marry, &rsquo;tis
far too noble game for such folk,&rdquo; he cried. Then
turning on V&ouml;geli, who with a dozen of his followers
had hastened to the spot, he sneeringly
exclaimed: &ldquo;So this is Swiss loyalty and valor, sir
Captain! A hundred against one! And for a few
paltry florins you forsake the colors to which you
swore allegiance. I wish you joy of the reward
this peasant rabble will doubtless pay you for your
treachery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>V&ouml;geli was silent, but one of the soldiers shouted
angrily: &ldquo;Why do we stand gaping here? Is there
no one to silence the scoundrel&rsquo;s vile calumnies?
If not, I will teach you to insult my master!&rdquo;
Raising his arm he was about to deal the Governor
a mighty blow, when one of the burghers restrained
him, saying: &ldquo;Nay, my good friend, to make such
short work of it were to lose half the pleasure.
This is matter for the executioner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words Hagenbach turned pale and said
no more. But he was not to go immediately to
the scaffold. With frenzied shouts of joy, they
took their way back to Brisach, which had been
entirely deserted by its inhabitants, women and
children, who now accompanied the procession
with jeers and taunts at the prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hagenbach, you Judas! you bloodhound! at
last we have you safe where you can no longer
torment us.&rdquo; The executioner, usually an object
of aversion, was now hailed in the most friendly
manner by all. &ldquo;Master Peter,&rdquo; they shouted to
him, &ldquo;this is work for you!&rdquo; and Peter, grinning,
tucked up his sleeves and struck at the air with his
sword, before the eyes of Hagenbach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems I am to do that man one more favor,&rdquo;
he declared with a sneering laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>When they reached the gates of the city, the
excited populace would have conducted the prisoner
at once to the place of execution, but some of the
more cool-headed citizens succeeded in dissuading
them. &ldquo;We are Austrians,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;and our lord
Duke Sigismund must pronounce sentence upon
the Governor. It is not for us to judge him.&rdquo;
Accordingly, four soldiers, four burghers, and four
of the nobles were chosen to guard the prisoner,
while V&ouml;geli with some of the citizens hastened to
Basle to acquaint Duke Sigismund with what had
occurred.</p>
<p>Two days later, toward evening, the Captain rode
slowly through the streets of that city on his way to
the inn of The Bears. How things had changed
since he had come this way for the first time!
Then he was an honored and honorable officer,
favored by the Duke, and a loyal servant to
Hagenbach. To-day he was a rebel. The Duke
would never pardon his disloyalty, and Hagenbach,
who had formerly valued him for his ability, was
now his mortal enemy, and through his agency a
prisoner. And all this for a few paltry florins, as
the Governor had said. Yet though he well knew
not one of his former comrades would credit him
with any other reason for his defection, he could
not altogether reproach himself. Were it all
to be done again he knew he should act no
differently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>This time Iseli himself came out to meet his
guest and assist him to dismount. &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo;
said he, as they ascended the stairway together,
&ldquo;to find that you bear me no ill will for what befell
you in my house, though truly it was through no
fault of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I be angry with you for that?&rdquo;
asked V&ouml;geli. &ldquo;But what news of your neighbor,
the good Councillor Irmy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the innkeeper proceeded to give a
detailed report concerning the welfare of his friend
and Walter. &ldquo;And you, Captain,&rdquo; he continued
inquisitively, &ldquo;what brings you to us again? Perchance
you have been sent by your Duke to collect
the sum advanced by the Swiss States for the
redemption of Alsace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly that,&rdquo; said V&ouml;geli; &ldquo;but tell me, is it true
that Duke Sigismund comes hither to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is said,&rdquo; replied Iseli. &ldquo;Doubtless you
have matters of importance to lay before the
Archduke?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>V&ouml;geli would fain have concealed his errand, but
the innkeeper plied his questions so adroitly that he
soon succeeded in extracting the whole story; and
when the Captain, wearied with his long ride, retired
to his chamber to rest, the news quickly spread
through the town that Hagenbach, the oppressor
of the Alsatians, the enemy of Switzerland as of
every right-minded man, had been taken prisoner
and the Archduke was to pronounce judgment
on him.</p>
<p>When Sigismund drew near the town the following
morning, he found the magistrates already at
the gates to welcome him.</p>
<p>V&ouml;geli had been riding at the Duke&rsquo;s side for half
an hour, having gone out earlier to meet him with the
news of Hagenbach&rsquo;s capture, and when Sigismund
dismissed him kindly, he turned his horse&rsquo;s head
toward The Bears once more. But the acclamations
that had followed the Duke were now centred
on the Captain, and his horse could make but slow
progress through the densely packed throngs that
filled the streets. When he at last dismounted he
was raised aloft on the shoulders of the sturdy
burghers and borne into the inn, where a number
of the patricians and citizens of Basle had assembled
to meet him. Among these were old Irmy and
Walter, with whom V&ouml;geli soon retired to his own
chamber to escape the praise and adulation so distasteful
to his modest nature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Iseli shall bring us some wine,&rdquo; said the
Councillor, &ldquo;and then I have something to propose
that I hope will please you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The host soon appeared with brimming tankards
and Irmy began: &ldquo;First of all, Captain, I beg you
will do me the honor to make my house your home
as often and as long as you may chance to be in
Basle. I have learned to esteem you highly, and
greatly desire that our friendship and our relations
in life should become closer. Walter is now
seventeen years old, and ever since I brought him
back from Treves he has been faithful and industrious,
and has learned something of business. But
he lacks a knowledge of much that cannot be
acquired by the fireside; the lad must travel, first
to Italy,&mdash;Genoa and Venice,&mdash;and when he has
mastered the Italian language and method of book-keeping
I shall send him to Nuremberg and
Augsburg, to Anton Fugger. This will mean an
absence of some years; but I am still active and can
perform the duties of my position without difficulty.
Walter is so young, however, that I am unwilling
to send him out into the world alone, and I should
be very glad if you would go with him and keep a
curb on the reckless fellow so that he shall not fall
into bad company or play any foolish pranks. As
to money, you shall have all that is needful, and
when you return there will be room for you both
in the business. Your experience in Freiburg will
serve you in good part there. I know Walter is
attached to you and will obey you as willingly as
he does me. If you are agreed, let us shake hands
on it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>V&ouml;geli gladly grasped the merchant&rsquo;s extended
palm, and the next morning he took up his abode
in the house, under whose hospitable roof he had
once been carried wounded and bleeding. The
landlord of The Bears flatly refused to accept
any pay for board and lodging, declaring he was
already far too much in the Captain&rsquo;s debt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Death of the Governor</span></h2>
<p>Archduke Sigismund decreed
that Hagenbach should be publicly tried
for his offences. Among the judges
appointed from Basle were Hans Irmy
and Ulrich Iseli, and with them came old Hassfurter
representing the city of Lucerne.</p>
<p>The judges assembled at Brisach, where they
were welcomed by Sigismund, who had already
been there for a fortnight inquiring into the case
of the prisoner. Full confession had been extorted
from Hagenbach by means of the rack, but there
were few proofs obtainable, even of his plot against
the lives and property of the citizens of Brisach.
Multitudes flocked thither from Switzerland, Alsace,
and the Black Forest to witness the trial of the
hated Governor. Along the whole length of the
Rhine from Basle to Strassburg he had not a single
friend. Little mercy could be expected from his
Alsatian judges, and even among the strangers invited
there were many whom he had greatly wronged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>A platform had been erected in the public square
for the judges and the accused; and facing it a bench
was placed upon which, shunned by all, yet objects
of universal interest, were seated seven headsmen,
rivals for the honor of executing sentence upon the
country&rsquo;s oppressor. Clad alike in long red cloaks,
they were in their places long before the judges
appeared. When these had finally assembled, Swiss,
Alsatians, and Sundgauers,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> the accused was led
thither, escorted by his guard and surrounded by
surging crowds. He walked with a firm step, not
heeding the taunts and jeers heaped upon him save
by an occasional contemptuous glance at the people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you shall reap your reward,&rdquo; shrieked a
woman&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;for plotting to sink all the women
and children to the bottom of the Rhine in leaky
boats!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! you would give our possessions as booty
to your mercenaries, would you?&rdquo; cried a well-to-do
baker, whose property was of considerable value.
&ldquo;It shall go ill with you for that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Pursued by such speeches, Hagenbach reached
the market place and took his seat while the tribunal
was forming. The Austrian deputy appointed
Ulrich Iseli as advocate for Archduke Sigismund,
while Peter von Hagenbach himself chose Irmy,
whose impartial love of justice was well known to
him. Thomas Sch&uuml;tz, the magistrate of Ensisheim,
opened the proceedings. About him were ranged
the twenty-six judges, among whom were included
sixteen knights, though to judge by their looks the
presence of these equals in rank lent the prisoner
but small hope of their clemency. Slowly the trial
proceeded. The advocate for the accused did his best,
but the verdict of death was certain from the beginning.</p>
<p>A storm of applause rent the air as the magistrate
of Ensisheim announced the result. The executioners,
who had hitherto remained passive, almost
indifferent spectators, suddenly became all attention
to learn in what manner the vengeance of their
countrymen was to be wrought upon Hagenbach.
Meanwhile the knights present required that the
condemned should be publicly stripped of the dignities
of his rank. Whereupon the Imperial herald
advanced and, causing the Governor to be brought
before him, demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who stands before me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The knight, Sir Peter von Hagenbach,&rdquo; was
the answer.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p5.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="490" />
<p class="caption"><i><span class="sc"><i>Hagenbach&rsquo;s</i></span> execution</i>
<br /><span class="small">(<i>After a woodcut in an old Swiss chronicle</i>)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Thrice the herald repeated: &ldquo;That is false. No
knight see I here, but a miscreant and a liar. Let
his sword be broken and his shield dragged in the
dust at a horse&rsquo;s tail.&rdquo; Then turning to the accused,
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Hagenbach, your conduct has been far from
knightly. It was your duty to render justice; to
protect the widow and orphan; to honor the Church
and its holy servants; to restrain all violence and
outrage: but you have yourself committed those
crimes which you should have punished in others.
Having broken, therefore, the oaths which you have
sworn, and forfeited the noble order of knighthood,
the knights here present have ordained that you
shall be deprived of its insignia. Let a true knight
come hither and take from him his arms and
honors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Hermann von Eptingen advanced. &ldquo;Peter
Hagenbach, I proclaim you unworthy knight of the
holy order of Saint George, and deprive you of
your sword, ring, collar, poniard, and spurs.&rdquo; Then
seizing a gauntlet, he struck the Governor on the
right cheek, saying: &ldquo;I pronounce you dishonored
and disarmed, and so shall you remain until your
death.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Turning to the knights, he added: &ldquo;Noble sirs,
I have, according to your decree, deprived Peter
Hagenbach of his insignia and caused him to be
publicly degraded. May this punishment serve as
an example to you, and may you ever live in accordance
with the dignity of knighthood and the honor
of your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this scene, the composure
displayed by the Governor throughout the whole
trial forsook him. The scornful gleam in his eyes
died out, his head sank upon his breast, and he
seemed to lose all consciousness of his surroundings.
But as he clearly realized the discussion concerning
the mode of his death, he broke down
completely, groaning: &ldquo;Mercy, mercy, your worships!
Grant me honorable death by the
sword!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shouts of triumph again rose from the people
when they beheld the proud nobleman bowed
humbly to the dust, but some of those in the front
ranks were moved to pity, and many secretly shed
tears. The judges unanimously agreed on death by
the sword. Preparations were made at once for the
execution of the sentence, which, greatly to his joy
and the envy of his fellows, was intrusted to the
headsman of Colmar, a short, thickset fellow,
accounted an expert with the sword.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Night had long since fallen and darkness covered
the earth, when Peter Hagenbach was conducted to
the scaffold. The judges rode in advance. Two
priests walked beside the condemned man, urging
him to confess his sins that his soul might not perish
with his body. Torches illuminated the dismal
scene. A vast crowd hemmed in the sad procession,
which, passing out through the Cooper&rsquo;s Gate,
reached an open meadow, where it halted. Hagenbach
conversed earnestly with the priests for some
moments, openly declared his repentance, and
bequeathed to the church of Brisach his sixteen
horses, his valuables, and his gold chain, for absolution
from his sins. With a firm step he mounted
the scaffold and, facing his judges and the people,
spoke thus with manly courage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear not death. Too often have I faced it on
the battle-field. I regret alone the blood which
mine will cause to be shed; for think not my master
will permit this day to pass unavenged. Grant me
your forgiveness, for Christ&rsquo;s and Our Lady&rsquo;s sake.
I am not guilty of all you have charged against me, yet
I humbly confess myself a sinner. Pray for me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>He knelt and received the death stroke. The
executioner of Colmar performed his duty well, but
not a shout arose, not a murmur of applause was
heard. Peter Hagenbach had shown he knew how
to die, and his death atoned for all.</p>

<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Battle of Granson</span></h2>
<p>For a time it appeared as if the death of
Hagenbach were to remain unavenged.
His brother, it is true, made some attempt
at retaliation and laid waste parts
of the country, but the cities felt secure behind their
walls, and laughed at the threats of the Burgundians.
Charles himself was occupied with other
matters and had no time to punish the judges of
his faithful servant. With his whole army of sixty
thousand men he lay encamped for nine long
months before the town of Neuss on the Lower
Rhine, wasting his time and his forces in a vain
endeavor to reduce its brave garrison to submission.
The Emperor meanwhile collected an army and,
crossing the Rhine, advanced to meet him. But
Frederick had no intention of fighting; after a few
skirmishes he deserted his allies, the King of France,
Duke Ren&eacute; of Lorraine, and the Swiss Confederates,
and made peace with the Duke of Burgundy.
Possibly he was not unwilling to abandon them to
Charles&rsquo;s vengeance; moreover, Burgundy would
thereby acquire valuable additions to her territory;
and Burgundy&mdash;so ran the treaty&mdash;was to be the
inheritance of Princess Maria, betrothed to the
young Archduke Maximilian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Charles&rsquo;s first move was to take possession of
Lorraine, after which he marched into Switzerland
and laid siege to Granson.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> A large part of his
court had followed him to the camp, where the utmost
luxury and extravagance prevailed. The Duke&rsquo;s
table was laid with massive gold plate, the costliest
wines were drunk from golden beakers, and the Burgundian
knights and nobles vied with one another
in splendor of display.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Far otherwise was it in the beleaguered town,
where the wretched fare and scanty rations grew
daily less, and still the promised relief did not appear.
The commander lacked firmness and decision,
moreover, while the garrison, which consisted
chiefly of the soldiers that had formerly revolted at
Brisach, looked back longingly on the flesh-pots of
the Burgundian camp. Meanwhile the Confederates
were assembling their forces with a deliberation
strongly opposed by the more sagacious leaders,
but they were powerless against the obstinate independence
of the free Swiss. When the army finally
moved to the relief of Granson, and was but a
day&rsquo;s march from the enemy, it was only to learn
that the town had already surrendered, and that the
entire garrison had been hanged, in direct violation
of the terms of the capitulation.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with shame and fury at the consequences
of their delay, they swore vengeance on the
Duke; and the next day a battle was fought, in
which the Burgundians were totally defeated and
driven out of Switzerland in confusion, leaving the
camp and all its treasures with four thousand wagon-loads
of provisions in the hands of the Swiss.
The first duty of the victors, however, was to bestow
honorable burial on the murdered garrison. By
tens and dozens the Burgundians had hanged them
to the branches of trees,&mdash;here father and son or
brothers side by side, there friends and relatives
together. In solemn procession the bodies were
borne to the monastery of the barefooted friars and
laid in a common grave, each with his arms beside
him, according to an old custom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>On the following morning the spoils were divided;
and great was the amazement of the Confederates
at the richness and splendor that everywhere met
their gaze. Here, piled in great heaps, was the
massive plate that had adorned the Duke&rsquo;s board at
Treves; there stood the silver chair heavily inlaid
with gold, valued at eleven thousand florins, in which
he was wont to receive foreign envoys; Charles&rsquo;s
headpiece, and his magnificent sword set with priceless
gems: all these treasures were tossed about by
the rough hands of the Switzers. Curious throngs
forced their way into the royal pavilion and marvelled
at the costly hangings interwoven with gold
and silver, upon which were depicted scenes from
Roman mythology. Upon the wall gleamed Burgundy&rsquo;s
escutcheon, emblazoned with the cross of
St. Andrew, and above it the Duke&rsquo;s proud motto,
&ldquo;I Watch.&rdquo; Watched? Aye, and lost! was but
too plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants tin plates?&rdquo; cried an honest
countryman, contemptuously. &ldquo;I have plenty of
those at home,&rdquo; and he sold the silver plates that
had fallen to his share for two silver groschen
apiece; while an archer proudly exhibited a shirt of
mail he had just received in exchange for a jewelled
diadem, saying, &ldquo;What could I have done with
such trumpery?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;There you were wise, my friend,&rdquo; declared the
dealer, who had willingly made the trade, for the
crown was worth thirty thousand thalers; &ldquo;and if
any others find these shining things somewhat
heavy to carry, come to me. I will give you good
round coin for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? Then mayhap we may strike a bargain,&rdquo;
said a Strassburger. &ldquo;Would ten florins be too
much for these twelve bright goblets? They are
much too heavy for gold, but any one not knowing
would easily buy them of you for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trader weighed the cups in his hand. They
might have been worth eighty marks in gold.
&ldquo;Truly they are heavy enough,&rdquo; he said doubtfully,
&ldquo;and I dare not overload my cart, for who
knows what profitable bargains are yet to be made?
Yet I would not have your ill will, and since it is
you I will do the best I can for you. Come, let us
say half a guilder apiece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Strassburger looked doubtfully at his companions.
&ldquo;If they should be gold, though&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, be not a fool, Thomas. You are not likely
to have another offer as good as that. What if they
be really gold? Gold is as cheap here as hazel nuts
with us at Martigny.&rdquo; At this the Strassburger
hesitated no longer, but gladly pocketed his six
guilders, and the trader went on his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis like the masqueraders at carnival time,&rdquo;
he said to himself as he met a group of cowherds
with costly garments of velvet, silk, and cloth of
gold flung over their smockfrocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at Ruodi! Is he not fine?&rdquo; gleefully
shouted one, pointing to the leader of the band,
who wore on his head a costly cap with waving
plumes, while upon his breast gleamed the gold
chain of the noble order of the Golden Fleece.
In another part of the camp a party of victorious
Switzers quarrelled and shouted over some casks of
Burgundy which they were drawing into gold and
silver flagons. &ldquo;Will you hold your good-for-nothing
tongues or shall I read you a text?&rdquo;
shouted one drunken fellow, waving aloft the
Duke&rsquo;s own prayer-book, bound in red velvet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us a song, Werni,&rdquo; cried several voices,
&ldquo;that will stop their noise. Come, strike up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Strike up&mdash;strike up!&rsquo; That is easily said,&rdquo;
growled Werni; &ldquo;for my part I would rather
drink than sing.&rdquo; Nevertheless he felt flattered
by the challenge, and without further protest
began:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Your camp with all its treasures rare</p>
<p class="t0">Has fallen to the Switzers&rsquo; share:</p>
<p class="t0">Oh fie! Duke Charles, for shame!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;fie! Duke Charles, for shame!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>all joined in rousing chorus.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Should such disgrace not break your pride,</p>
<p class="t0">Come back, fresh armies at your side,</p>
<p class="t0">We&rsquo;ll serve you just the same.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll serve you just the same,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>echoed the singers enthusiastically. Then others
gathering about the rude minstrel took up the
strain, till far and wide resounded the triumphant
notes of the ballad of the battle of Granson. How
every heart swelled as Werni, hoarse and weary,
concluded:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Confederation, whate&rsquo;er betide,</p>
<p class="t0">Doth ever fast and firm abide,</p>
<p class="t0">As this day well hath proven;</p>
<p class="t0">The fame of Granson&rsquo;s martial band</p>
<p class="t0">Shall ring triumphant through the land,</p>
<p class="t0">With praises interwoven.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Hero of Murten</span></h2>
<p>Before midsummer Charles the Bold had
repaired his losses as well as his means
would permit, and levied a new army.
His subjects had begun to murmur and
lose faith in his success, but the Duke himself
remained undaunted. He had advanced dangerously
near to the Cantons of Berne and Freiburg,
and was now laying siege to Murten, a strongly
fortified town on the lake of that name. He expected
it to share the fate of Granson; but the
commander, Adrian von Bubenberg, was a very
different sort of man from the leader of that ill-fated
garrison. In vain the besiegers shot arrows
into the town wound with slips of paper bearing
such inscriptions as: &ldquo;You are shut up here like
rats in a hole. The Bernese churls cannot save you,
and all the gold in the world would not buy you
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Threats and promises were alike of no avail.
&ldquo;The perjurers of Granson will never find credence
in Murten,&rdquo; was the commander&rsquo;s reply to all
proposals of surrender; nor was he less firm in
suppressing all signs of wavering within the walls.
Summoning the citizens and soldiers before him, he
addressed them sternly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark ye, all! I hereby proclaim that he who
dares to whisper of surrender, be he of the town or of
the garrison, is a dastard and a poltroon, and shall
be struck down on the spot. So shall we separate
the wheat from the chaff. And if one word of fear
or weakening escape my lips, let me be made the
first example.&rdquo; This effectually silenced all murmurs
or complaints; and the Confederates at last assembled
an army and advanced to their relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Rough, mountainous country and thick forests
separated the Swiss from the Burgundian camp,
which had been pitched on the plateau of Grisach
behind rising ground, and was protected by a so-called
&ldquo;hedge,&rdquo; a palisade surrounded on the outside
by a wide trench, while within the earth had been
thrown up to form a sort of breastwork for the
defenders, and only the narrowest openings were
left for outlet in case of need; to break through it
in face of the mounted guns would seem well-nigh
impossible. Moreover, behind this fortification
stood the English archers ready with their deadly
shafts to repulse any attempt at approach. The
position was not badly chosen, and was disadvantageous
only in that it afforded the cavalry no
proper field for action.</p>
<p>Through these mountains two travellers were making
their way. One of them was evidently laboring
under some stress of mind, for he alternately spurred
on and abruptly reined in his fiery steed, which
was covered with foam, while the animal ridden by
his more youthful companion still appeared fresh.
He spoke little and kept his eyes fixed gloomily on
the road that led to the camp of the Confederates.
Soon they were challenged by the outposts, and the
elder rider asked to be guided to the forces furnished
by the city of Freiburg. A servant conducted them
to that part of the encampment, and Hans V&ouml;geli,
the Captain of the band, stepped forward to learn
their errand. Speech forsook him, however, when
his eyes fell upon the older of the two horsemen,
who reached down his hand kindly, saying, &ldquo;You
know me, then, brother Hans? I have come hither
to fight beside you. That I am an exile from my
native city, I well know, but to-morrow I hope to
win back with my sword my right to citizenship.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>A scornful look came over the face of Hans
V&ouml;geli. &ldquo;So!&rdquo; he said contemptuously, &ldquo;now that
your master is on the verge of destruction, you
deem it well to work with us for the Fatherland!
Now the vagabond comes back and expects us to
believe that he means fairly by us&mdash;as fairly, no
doubt, as by his Duke and by the Governor whom
he betrayed for the sake of a few months&rsquo; pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heinrich made no reply to these harsh words.
He knew it was useless to attempt to change his
brother&rsquo;s sentiments toward him, but turning to his
countrymen he reminded them of their boyhood
days together; explained his reasons for entering
the service of Burgundy, and besought permission
to join them in the coming struggle, declaring he
would prove himself not unworthy to fight in their
ranks. Many were inclined in his favor, but Hans
V&ouml;geli cut matters short by roughly ordering both
the riders to leave the camp at once. Perceiving
the fruitlessness of his efforts, Heinrich turned his
horse&rsquo;s head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Walter,&rdquo; he said simply, and they made
their way back through the camp to the outposts
again. Walter Irmy, for he it was, did not venture
to address his moody companion, and they galloped
off in silence to the nearest farmhouse, where they
obtained lodgings for the night. Early the next
morning they were again in the saddle and rode
back to the camp, only to find it already broken up
and the army advancing to meet the enemy. From
some horseboys V&ouml;geli learned that the Freiburgers
were in the vanguard and were to begin the attack
that day. Slowly they followed after, and soon
overtook the Confederates, who had halted where
a thick forest concealed them from the eyes of the
enemy, to observe their old custom of knighting
before battle those most deserving of the honor.
The first to receive it was Ren&eacute; the dispossessed
Duke of Lorraine, who had joined the Confederates
with three hundred faithful followers to fight against
Charles the Bold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>The impatient Switzers loudly protested against
this delay, the more so as a heavy rain had been
falling for some time. But the solemn ceremonies
were not to be curtailed, nor was Duke Ren&eacute;, the
new knight, sparing in conferring the coveted
honor. Many an honest fellow, indeed, without
the necessary means to maintain his dignities, was
forced to submit to the stroke of knighthood. It
came to an end at last, however, and the handsome
young prince remounted and rode slowly back to join
his friends, followed by the admiring gaze of the
Swiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a pity,&rdquo; they declared, &ldquo;the noble lord
is not of German blood: we cannot understand a
word of his French gabble.&rdquo; The delay that had
been so irksome to the Swiss proved to their
advantage in the end, for the Burgundians, after
getting drawn up for battle in the drenching rain six
long hours, with no sign of the enemy&rsquo;s approach,
had been ordered to return to the camp, where they
quickly laid aside arms and armor and dispersed in
search of rest or refreshment. The jaded chargers
were also divested of their trappings and fed; even
the Duke himself, usually so vigilant, retired to his
pavilion at some distance from the camp and seated
himself with his officers at the board.</p>
<p>Suddenly the Confederates issued from the forest
which had concealed their approach and, halting
once more, after the custom of their forefathers,
knelt to invoke the aid of the God of Battles. An
old gray-beard made the short prayer, all devoutly
joining in the &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; Just at that moment the
sun broke through the clouds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven has heard our prayer!&rdquo; shouted the
leaders joyfully. &ldquo;Comrades, be stanch and bold!
Think of your wives, your children, and your
sweethearts! Forward, Confederates!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They fling themselves furiously against the
breastwork, but the enemy&rsquo;s guns tear great gaps
in their ranks, and arrow after arrow is sped with
deadly aim by the English bowmen. Vainly the
assailants strive to surmount or demolish the sharp
palisades. The bannerman of Freiburg is struck
down. Suddenly the sound of galloping hoofs
approaches, and the powerful voice of Heinrich
V&ouml;geli is heard shouting encouragement to his
wavering countrymen. Hailing his appearance with
shouts of joy, they rally, and like a torrent the
Swiss vanguard sweeps through a gap in the
&ldquo;hedge,&rdquo; V&ouml;geli at their head. Hans is forgotten;
all eyes are fixed on the gallant soldier fighting so
bravely in the foremost rank, as gun after gun is
captured and turned against the enemy&rsquo;s camp.
On clatter the squadrons of Lombard cuirassiers,
but the deadly fire of their own guns, and a furious
assault from the Swiss foot soldiers, led by V&ouml;geli,
soon put them to rout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Still the Confederates pour through the intrenchment.
Charles retreats, hoping to obtain a better
position, but close upon him press the Freiburgers,
V&ouml;geli bearing their banner aloft in his left hand
while with the right he wields his victorious sword.
The English archers rally once more; but their
ranks are thinning fast, and when their leader, the
Duke of Somerset, is slain they break and give
way. Only one band still holds its ground, the
Swiss pikemen, who will not yield. V&ouml;geli, loath
to continue this unnatural warfare, promises them
pardon, but they reject his offer and fight on more
fiercely than before. Suddenly one of them, whom
both he and Walter Irmy&mdash;who has never left his
side&mdash;recognize as Heini S&uuml;ssbacher, springs at
V&ouml;geli.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Traitor!&rdquo; he shouts, and with one blow brings
Heinrich&rsquo;s horse to the ground. Others now have
recognized the Captain, and he and Walter are
instantly surrounded and cut off from their comrades.
Heini&rsquo;s hand is already outstretched to
seize the banner when V&ouml;geli&rsquo;s sword cleaves his
helm and down he falls. Like a wounded boar,
the Freiburger struggles to defend his standard, and
Walter keeps stoutly at his side, while the Swiss
strive to come to their rescue. Hacking and hewing
madly, they cut their way through the throng that
presses about the two heroes, and reach them just as
Heinrich, mortally wounded, sinks beside his horse,
still clutching firmly the banner of his native city,
while the enemy turn and flee.</p>
<p>Hans V&ouml;geli kneels beside his dying brother and,
taking the hand that holds the banner, implores
forgiveness for all the wrongs he has done him.
Tightly clasping the other, young Irmy, speechless
with grief, awaits the death of the man who for two
years has been the best and kindest of friends to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hans,&rdquo; says Heinrich faintly, &ldquo;will you acknowledge
now my right to citizenship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, truly, Heinrich,&rdquo; his brother assures him,
sobbing, and in hushed tones the Freiburgers
standing by confirm the promise. With a sigh of
content the dying man sinks back and soon expires,
his pallid features lit with a smile of blissful peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Meanwhile the victorious Confederates had reached
the shore of Lake Murten, where a singular spectacle
met their eyes. The Burgundians, finding their
retreat by the south shore cut off, were endeavoring
by wading and swimming to reach the other side
and join the Count de Romont&rsquo;s force, which had
been lying before the city of Murten, but was now
skirting the shore of the lake in rapid retreat. It
was a mad attempt. Already hundreds of the
heavily armed soldiers were sticking fast in the oozy
bed of the lake, while those who succeeded in reaching
deep water soon sank or were slain by the
arrows despatched at every head that showed above
the surface. Even the trees afforded no safety.
Many of the despairing Lombards had sought concealment
among the dense foliage, but they were
soon discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, look at the crows,&rdquo; shouted the pursuers,
jocularly, &ldquo;and yonder are some squirrels!&rdquo; and the
unfortunate fugitives were remorselessly shot down,
despite their prayers for mercy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>That night the conquerors camped upon the field
of battle, rejoicing over their easy and decisive victory,
but much disappointed at the lack of plunder.
The following morning the Freiburgers and all
who had loved Captain V&ouml;geli assembled about his
bier. Supported by a band of his faithful followers,
the body was borne in solemn procession to
Freiburg, whither news of the event had already
preceded them. Beside the bier rode Hans V&ouml;geli
and Walter Irmy. Tolling of bells greeted their
approach to the city, at the gates of which the Mayor
and Council awaited the return of the wanderer;
and when some days later all that was mortal
of Heinrich V&ouml;geli was laid to rest in the family
vault, the banner of Freiburg was draped about
his coffin, while at the dead man&rsquo;s head lay a certificate
of citizenship placed there by order of the
Council. Thus was V&ouml;geli&rsquo;s dearest wish accomplished,
and in his beloved Fatherland he rested
forever from the storms of life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Faithful unto Death</span></h2>
<p>Duke Ren&eacute; was pacing restlessly to
and fro in the guest room of the inn
of The Bears at Basle. &ldquo;Nancy will
surely hold out,&rdquo; he murmured half
aloud; &ldquo;it must. The burghers know I am coming
to their relief as soon as possible. In truth it has
been no easy matter to induce the Swiss to repay the
assistance I have lent them; but at last all is ready,
and I must find some way of warning my good
subjects of Nancy that relief is at hand. But neither
Siffrein nor yet the youth from Basle shall risk his
life in such an attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the door opened and Siffrein de
Baschi, the Duke&rsquo;s faithful steward, entered. He
was dressed as for a journey, and his dark eyes
gleamed triumphantly as he said to his master:
&ldquo;How does my new travelling costume please Your
Highness? Truly, &rsquo;tis somewhat soiled; but a
minstrel must not be too fine, and tarnished finery
will attract the less suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Ren&eacute; gazed in astonishment at the transformation.
Had not every feature of the handsome face
with its winning smile been so familiar to him he
would never have recognized the knight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In travelling dress! What means this, Siffrein?
Surely you will not persist in your mad resolve to
go to Nancy? Abandon it, I charge you. Think
of the grief it would cause me were any harm to
befall you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, gracious lord,&rdquo; entreated Siffrein, &ldquo;grant
me leave to go. Even should they capture me I
shall not lose my head upon the spot, and they will
do well if they catch me, I promise you. Young
Irmy waits without. Will you not hear his plan at
least?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for an answer he flung open the
door and beckoned to Walter to enter. The
Duke&rsquo;s eyes rested approvingly on the youth&rsquo;s
stalwart figure and honest German face. Extending
his hand to him, he said kindly: &ldquo;Methinks,
sir, we are already acquainted. I saw you fight
beside Heinrich V&ouml;geli at Murten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I, too, saw Your Highness,&rdquo; replied Walter;
&ldquo;and there is not a Switzer but would gladly serve
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;For those fair words I give you thanks,&rdquo; said
the Duke, &ldquo;but this service you now would render
me I cannot accept; &rsquo;tis a foolish and a useless
risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craving Your Highness&rsquo;s pardon, I do not
think it so,&rdquo; answered the youth. &ldquo;Old Gerard
has agreed to get us safely into Nancy, and he may
be depended on to keep his word. He is a smuggler
by trade and has often fetched merchandise for my
father through the enemy&rsquo;s camp. The Burgundian
mercenaries know him well, and he is quite
safe among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is the slightest risk of danger I cannot
consent to your going,&rdquo; declared the Duke, &ldquo;for it
is not needful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; interposed Siffrein, &ldquo;surely it is most
imperative that the citizens of Nancy be informed
that relief is at hand; else they may surrender the
town, and so through our fault be delivered over to
the vengeance of Charles the Bold, who will not
easily pardon them that the siege has already lasted
well into the winter.&rdquo; Walter also continued to
urge the dependence that might be placed on old
Gerard, till the Duke finally yielded and reluctantly
gave them leave to depart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Siffrein had donned the garb of a troubadour
with a lute slung over his shoulder, deeming that
the safest guise in which to make his way through
the enemy&rsquo;s camp; but Walter convinced him that
it would be of little avail, since even a minstrel
would scarcely be permitted to pass the outposts.
Accordingly, when they set out on their errand an
hour later, it was in ordinary travelling dress, but
each was well armed. At Vandemont they met
Gerard with some of his comrades, who for high
pay had been engaged to smuggle powder into the
besieged city, and were therefore accustomed to
risking their lives. The two newcomers were also
given a leather sack of powder to carry on their
shoulders, and when night had fallen the little band
set forth. Following silently one behind the other,
they crept along sword in hand, ready to sell their
lives dearly if need were, until they reached an
abbey in the depths of the forest. Here Siffrein
made himself known, and they were given a ready
welcome by the monks, who offered refreshments
to the adventurers to fortify them for the last stage
of their perilous journey. Old Gerard vanished,
to reappear half an hour later with the information
that there were no sentries visible on that side of
the camp, and there seemed a good chance of their
reaching the town unobserved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Preparations for departure were hastily completed,
and the little band cautiously made their way to the
camp. True enough, the sentries had all vanished,
either because the bitter cold had driven them into
their tents or because Gerard had won them over.
The old man whistled softly three times, which
may have been a prearranged signal. At all events
the silent figures glided unmolested through the
rows of tents. Not so much as a head was thrust
forth into the cold air to spy on the nocturnal
visitors, and they soon reached the outworks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder is the spot,&rdquo; whispered Gerard, pointing
to a bulwark the dark outlines of which stood out
against the walls of the city. Now the moat lay
before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vive Lorraine!&rdquo; shouted Siffrein, as Gerard
carefully lowered himself to its icy surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>But the thoughtless cry aroused the sentries, who
came running from all sides. Walter and the
smugglers were already climbing up the wall and
Siffrein had sprung upon the ice to follow them,
when alas! it gave way. Down he sank to his
shoulders in the water, and before help from Nancy
could reach him the Burgundians had dragged him
forth and borne him back to the camp shaking in
an ague from his icy bath.</p>
<p>Gerard tried to reassure Walter as to the fate of
his companion. &ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; he said soothingly;
&ldquo;he is a nobleman and Duke Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s steward. They
will not dare to harm a hair of his head. Had it
been one of us, now, they would have made short
work of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great were the rejoicings in Nancy at the news
of speedy relief, and at daybreak one of the cannoniers
loaded his gun with some of the powder brought
by the smugglers, muttering to himself: &ldquo;It is long
since I was able to feed this big fellow. Much
good may it do the Burgundians,&rdquo; he added,
and thrusting a ball into the mouth of his cannon,
took long and careful aim. &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; he
said, doffing his cap, while a gunner held the match
to the touchhole. Crash! went the shot, and a
cloud of dust and splinters rose as it struck one of
the enemy&rsquo;s batteries. The Burgundians were slow
in responding, for they too were short of powder.
Charles&rsquo;s army had suffered greatly. The siege of
Neuss, and the battles of Granson and Murten,
together with the severity of the weather and the
lack of proper provisions, had reduced the number
of his troops to six thousand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Toward evening a rumor spread through the city
that Siffrein de Baschi had been hanged by order
of Charles the Bold. It was scarcely credited, but
the next morning brought melancholy proof. The
Burgundians were induced with difficulty to deliver
up the corpse of the faithful steward, which was
drawn up the walls in a silken cloth amid the tolling
of bells, and buried with solemn ceremonies. Great
was the mourning of the people over his untimely
end, for the favorite of their adored young Duke
was universally beloved and had no enemies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Death of Charles the Bold</span></h2>
<p>Night had fallen and silence brooded over
the Burgundian camp, upon which the
snow was falling in heavy flakes. In the
forest near the abbey a man stood leaning
against a tree striving to penetrate the thick snow
clouds that filled the air. &ldquo;Why does not Giacomo
come?&rdquo; he muttered to himself in Italian. &ldquo;It is too
cold in this cursed country to wait long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not have to,&rdquo; replied a voice near him,
&ldquo;for I am here already and have brought with me
as much as I could carry away from my canteen.
It will soon be up with them over yonder,&rdquo; he
added, motioning toward the camp, &ldquo;and methinks
we shall do well to join the Swiss. Then at least
there will be some hope of getting back to our
own beautiful land.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The first speaker wore the uniform of a cuirassier,
and was no other than the former servant in
the wine shop at Treves. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said
musingly, &ldquo;how long our comrades will stand by the
Duke. It is long since he gave us any pay. Our
fare is wretched, and the cold unbearable to us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giacomo produced some food from his bundle,
and the two men walked on through the forest,
eating as they went. Suddenly they paused. Was
that the trampling of horses&rsquo; hoofs they heard? The
cuirassier laid his ear to the ground. Yes, there was
no doubt a large body of horsemen was approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can they be following us?&rdquo; asked Giacomo
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely not,&rdquo; replied his companion, &ldquo;but something
must be afoot. It may be a night attack on
the Swiss. In any case we shall do well to conceal
ourselves behind these juniper bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer came the horsemen, the hard-frozen
ground re&euml;choing to the heavy tread of
armored steeds. Deeper into the thicket shrank
the two deserters, as the clang of arms resounded
so close to them they almost feared to be trampled
upon. But the troop passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you recognize any one?&rdquo; asked Giacomo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;but it seemed to me I
heard the voice of our commander, Campo Basso.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;So I thought too,&rdquo; said the sutler. &ldquo;Can it be
that they are deserting? It is said the Count has
been mortally offended by the Duke of Burgundy,
and it is possible they are going over to the Swiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They said no more but followed the riders along
the road to Saint Nicholas. On their arrival the
next day they found the wildest excitement prevailing.
The Confederates had occupied the town
on the preceding day, and the Count of Campo Basso
with one hundred and eighty lances had come early
that morning to proffer his services to Duke Ren&eacute;.
The offer had been accepted, so Giacomo and his
companion returned to the society of their comrades.</p>
<p>At daybreak on the fifth of January, 1477, the
Burgundians prepared for battle, for Duke Ren&eacute;
and the Swiss were close at hand. As Charles the
Bold was arming himself, the golden lion of Burgundy
fell from his helm into the dust. &ldquo;It is a
sign from Heaven,&rdquo; he said gloomily; and so indeed
it proved, for at the first onslaught of the enemy,
panic seized the Burgundians and they fled in confusion,
while the citizens of Nancy sallied forth to
attack them in the rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Walter Irmy was one of the first outside the gates
of the city and soon found ample opportunity to
prove his valor; for the combined forces of the
Swiss, with Duke Ren&eacute; and the Alsatians, drove
the whole of Charles&rsquo;s fast diminishing army back
upon Nancy. Most of the faithless mercenaries
followed Count Campo Basso&rsquo;s example; but the
Burgundian nobles, who formed a large part of the
army, still fought on with the courage of despair.
Many a stroke did Walter parry and return ere the
burghers of Nancy could gain any advantage; but
at last the foe began to weaken. Smiting one of the
Burgundian knights from his horse, Walter swung
himself into the empty saddle from whence he could
overlook the scene of conflict. The Swiss and
Alsatians were now but a few hundred feet away,
and the enemy took to flight, hotly pursued by the
conquerors on horse and foot.</p>
<p>Suddenly the shout arose, &ldquo;Yonder is the Duke!
Stop him, stop him!&rdquo; and on still faster pressed the
pursuers. But Charles was better mounted than
most of his foes, and soon but a handful of riders
were left in pursuit of the flying Prince, whose
followers had by this time dwindled to some thirty
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can no one capture the Duke?&rdquo; cried one of
the Alsatian leaders in despair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will try,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;he must reckon with
me for the death of Siffrein de Baschi,&rdquo; and spurring
to furious speed the superb animal he had just
captured, he soon overtook the fugitives. Paying
no heed to the others, he urged his steed close
beside that of the Duke, and the next moment their
swords had crossed. In the frantic flight no one
thought of the Duke, and the two antagonists now
found themselves on a meadow, the icy surface of
which had been thawed out by the noonday sun, so
that the horses&rsquo; feet sank deep into the ground at every
step. Charles dealt one mighty blow at his assailant,
but it was his last, for the next instant the Switzer&rsquo;s
blade had pierced his helm, and the great Duke
sank lifeless to the ground. Walter had no time
to rejoice over his victory, however; the Prince&rsquo;s
followers now attacked him, and after exchanging a
few blows he too fell sorely wounded.</p>
<p>By this time others of the pursuers had come up
and a hand-to-hand conflict began, in which fifteen
more of the Burgundian nobles were slain. But
no one heeded the fallen, and when the survivors
again took to flight the conquerors raced after, still
supposing the Duke to be among them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>After sundown it grew bitter cold. Walter tried
to shield himself from it, but in vain. He was too
weak even to loosen a cloak from the saddle of a
horse that lay beside him. Between cold and hunger
and the pain of his wounds he fell into a sort of
stupor. Visions of the past floated through his
mind. Now he seemed to see his own father lying
with his brave comrades among the ruins of the
hospital at Saint Jacob; again, he was a boy at home
in his own warm bed, while the mother, whom he
had followed to her grave seven years before, bent
over her loved one to kiss him good-night. He
could see her eyes shining down upon him&mdash;but no!
it was not his mother&rsquo;s warm breath he felt upon
his cheek. He started up in terror, and the wolf
whose eyes he had seen shining above him in the
darkness slunk away scared. By good fortune
Walter had his sword beside him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>The visions and phantasies that had haunted his
brain were swept away by the frightful reality. He
was lying wounded and alone amid a pile of corpses,
upon which the wolves had already begun to appease
their hunger. No longer conscious of pain or weakness,
he sat upright and grasped the handle of his
sword, firmly resolved to defend his life to the last
against the horrible beasts. But the dead horses
were sufficient prey for the wolves, and it was only
now and then that one came to sniff at the wounds
of some fallen knight. They held aloof from the
young Swiss, and as the morning light dawned at
last, they slunk away one after another to their
lairs in the dark ravines of the mountains. Walter
fell back senseless, and was still unconscious when
some hours later he was lifted in strong arms and
carried back within the walls of Nancy, whither he
had come a few weeks previously to bring the glad
tidings of relief.</p>
<p>It was long before the body of Charles the Bold
was discovered. It had been so mutilated by the
wolves that none but a page and the Duke&rsquo;s own
physician, who had been taken prisoner, could
identify it. Enveloped in a white cloth, the corpse
was borne to the city on a bier by some of the nobles
of Lorraine. The following day all that remained
of Charles the Bold was laid upon a black velvet
bed of state, ornamented with a cross of white satin
and six escutcheons. The dead man was wrapped
in a white satin robe, the jewelled ducal coronet upon
his head, over which a red cap had been drawn to
conceal its disfigurement. The feet were encased
in scarlet hose, with golden spurs. Between two
heralds stood two magnificent stools, on which a
consecrated cushion and a red cross were placed.
Four other heralds stood with lighted torches at the
corners of the bed of state. The room was hung
with black, and two tapers burned on an altar before
which the services for the dead were to be performed.
Ranged about the walls were seats, also draped in
black, for the use of Ren&eacute; and the nobles of
Alsace and Lorraine, who were to assist at the
ceremonies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Beside the bed, and bowed with grief, knelt
Anton, a half-brother of Charles. Though reviled
by the Duke as a bad and ungrateful kinsman,
he now refused to be parted from the dead. His
sobs, the outpouring of the grief of a brave soldier,
penetrated the hearts of all who entered the room.
Last came Duke Ren&eacute; clad in deepest mourning,
but wearing, in accordance with the old knightly
custom, a long beard of spun gold, in token of
victory over a princely foe who had fallen in battle.
With deep emotion he grasped the hand of the
dead, saying in a low voice: &ldquo;God rest your
soul, fair cousin! Much sorrow and trouble have
you caused us, yet &rsquo;twas by no will of ours that
you were brought to this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>After sprinkling the corpse with holy water he
knelt before the altar, where he remained in prayer
while the knights and courtiers of Burgundy and
Lorraine paid the last honors to Charles the Bold.</p>
<p>On the twelfth of January, 1477, the last Duke
of Burgundy was laid to rest in St. George&rsquo;s Church
at Nancy, whence he was removed in 1550 by his
mighty great-grandson the Emperor Charles the
Fifth, who wished that the remains of his ancestor
might be buried in his native town of Bruges.</p>
<p>Freed at last from their bitterest enemy, and
crowned with victory, the Swiss returned to their
homes and exchanged the implements of war for
those of peace. With his youth and strength,
Walter Irmy was soon restored to health and to the
arms of his father, whose large business he conducted
to the entire satisfaction of the worthy Councillor.
Honored by his fellow-citizens and beloved by his
people, he lived long and happily with his good
wife, surrounded by a group of children who were
the joy and delight of their grandfather.</p>
<p>Who knows? Perchance his spirit lingers yet
about the good city of Basle, ready to prove to the
enemies of his country that the victors of Granson
and Murten have not perished, but still live on in
the courage and valor of their descendants.</p>
